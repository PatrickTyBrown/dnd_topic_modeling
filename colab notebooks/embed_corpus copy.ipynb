Thank you so much for tuning in. Oh my gosh, everybody, today I am so excited for the incredible guest who\\'s gonna be here talking with us about all things tabletop. You know her work. She is an animation TV writer for \"My Little Pony',\n"," ' Heroes of Pure Heart.\" She\\'s also a dungeon master. You\\'ve seen her dungeon mastering on \"Girls Guts Glory,\" which is streamed from Wizards of the Coast. And you also can find her musical that she wrote and directed, \"STARRY,\" the musical, available on Spotify right now, as well as an upcoming project, which is gonna be incredible and D&D, an all-native D&D actual play show coming soon to a live stream near you. We are so excited to have her here on the show. Please give it up for Kelly Lynne D\\'Angelo. Equestria Girls,\" \"Final Space,\" and \"Mao Mao',\n"," ' Yeah, this is big, woo, the crowd goes wild. I blush, I grab all the stuffed animals and flowers that you throw to me on my mental ice-skating rink.(both laughing)',\n"," '\\xa0Flowers, (laughs) flowers, flowers. Kelly, it is so wonderful and an honor for us to have you on the show today. Thank you so much for making the time to come by.',\n"," \"\\xa0Thanks for having me, Brennan. It's really exciting to be here. I am honored to be among this amazing list of folks you've had on your show, and also getting the chance to talk with you. It's just, it's really exciting, so thanks for having me.\",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, I\\'m so, so glad, thank you so much. We\\'re gonna start… Normally, we do a half hour of conversation, and then move into questions. Kelly, you actually got a question that is not even a question, I just wanted to start with it. The person says it\\'s not a question. This is from one of ourDiscord users, TurboMan. And it was just so sweet that I had to start right away with it. \"Kelly Lynne, you and Joey Clift have been incredible voices for native representation entertainment, no question. Just wanted to express my appreciation for everything you do.\" So a little bit of-',\n"," \"\\xa0Thank you so much, thank you, TurboMan. (laughing drowns out speaker) That's just so thoughtful.\",\n"," '\\xa0Very, very lovely. We put up on our Discord that you were gonna be coming on the show to get some questions, and we just had that lovely compliment right out of the gate. Kelly, talk to me a little bit about you, your love for tabletop, where it started, what your journey beginning into tabletop RPGs started as and where it brought you.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, so it's been an interesting journey for me. I'm from Upstate New York, I'm from Rochester, and whole family's from Buffalo. So if you throw pretty much a dart at somewhere in Upstate New York, I have been from there, family's from there. I've lived there or I know it too well. That is just my experience. But growing up in Upstate, especially if you're from around there, and with the dynamism that my family had, as well, on both sides, there's not much to do. You've got your local, if you're lucky, within walking distance, I wasn't as lucky, but you have your movie theater, you have the outdoors, you have air and water and food on the table, (laughs) and I'm trying to think of what else you have. There's other stimuluses, but they're further away. You have to have a car, but generally speaking, it's a quaint life, and it's pretty simple. And I had always, as a young girl, stretched the borders and wanted more. I always felt I had it... I think I was just hyperactive. I mean, there's a lot of things we can dive into on that. But I've always had a lot of energy and I still do, kind of to this day. (laughs) So when I was really young, I was really, really active. I was dancing all the time. I was doing tons of extracurriculars, but it also put me into this weird space as young child where I was kind of a weird one. I was not just the black sheep in my school, but kind of the black sheep in the family. I was reading at advanced level, I was studying a lot. I wanted to learn a bunch of things, and I was just kind of weird. And it led to me kind of searching for this sense of belonging or this sense of community or comfort, especially exercising how overactive my mind was with storytelling. Did I play with Barbie dolls until I was 13? Did I play with Legos 'til I was 13? Did I give every single toy car that my family let me inherit, did I give them front stories and backstories and give them names and create a teen drama with every single toy car that I ever had? The answer to all of these things are yes.(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0And it led to me (laughs) not having a lot of friends, which is fine. I was a young girl who didn\\'t want to have to dumb herself down and didn\\'t want to have to pretend to be anything than what and who I was, which led to having to need a lot of self awareness and self resilience, which kind of brought me into community theater, (laughs) because that was a great place to story tell and explore and be creative and let all of that extra energy that I had in out. And hilariously enough, community theater in Upstate New York, it being kind of my out, is also what led me to Dungeons & Dragons. Kind of a weird connect, but I swear it makes sense because being one of the few people who was kind of on the outskirts of everything, I\\'m native, I didn\\'t feel like I fit in, my mascot for a long time growing up was The Indians. So I just lived in a world where I just didn\\'t see myself. And I tried to find friends nearby who felt like they understood what it felt like to be the other. And you find that in community theater, especially in a very quaint city, very small, very suburban, very white neighborhood that doesn\\'t really embrace people who maybe have different interests in different partners or LGBTQts, the whole spectrum. So while I was kind of navigating that, I found some people within the community theater space who were gay, who was my closest friends, and they were actually the first people to kind of, after one day after rehearsal, one of them pulled me aside and whispered, \"Hey, do you-\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0It was like this, \"Hey, do you want to do something that I know you shouldn\\'t do?\" And I just turned to them and I\\'m just like, \"What are you thinking, are we playing a video game? Are we playing \\'Grand Theft Auto,\\' what\\'s going on?\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0How risky are we going? And he turns to me and he goes, \"No, I\\'m a dungeon master. And I think you\\'d really enjoy playing D&D with me.\" His name is Nick, he\\'s wonderful, he lives in San Fran now. And I was just like, \"You know what? Let\\'s get some of our friends together and do it. I want to play.\" And he\\'s like, \"You grew up really, really Catholic. Don\\'t tell your mom.\" And I\\'m like, \"You don\\'t understand. I don\\'t tell my mom a lot of things. (laughs) We\\'ll all play at the table secretively together.\" \\'Cause I only understood it as the satanic panic, and I kind of grew up with it kind of being this hidden thing that nobody should talk about, much like being bi myself and things like that. So there\\'s a lot of hidden stuff, but D&D helped so much because we sat around the table. It was the weirdest group of players in the world who were all eccentric community theater kids. And we played, and that first taste when I was 15 or 14, I was very young, that first taste that I got, I was like, Oh my goodness, I want more. And so we got the chance to play a few other times during some rehearsals, but then eventually that led once the community show was over, it led to us not playing as consistently together \\'cause we couldn\\'t get all the rides from our parents.(both laughing)',\n"," '\\xa0I just hungered for it, hungered for it, hungered for it all throughout college, asking people, whispering it in the shadows of Syracuse halls underneath Hendricks Chapel, \"Do you play D&D?\" I was at parties, and when I would overhear someone say, \"D&D,\" my head would whip around and I would go over and ask if they played. People will say that I did this. It was a real thing. And thankfully, once I moved out to LA, right after graduating Syracuse, one of my roommates was a dungeon master. So I got the chance to play with him a little bit more, but eventually I realized I\\'m going to have to be a DM. There\\'s just... constantly hunting for a DM, constantly wanting to play, I need to start sort of rekindling that fire within me, but where do I even begin to talk? And I kid you not, when I say I started, I was... I love YouTube and I\\'m obsessed with it. Hey, \"CollegeHumor,\" obsessed with YouTube, you guys are great. I\\'m not upset that you guys didn\\'t hire me as an intern back in 2011, we won\\'t talk about that.(both laughing) ',\n"," ' The Last Airbender.\\'? Are you talking about \\'Riverdale\\'?\" I\\'m like, \"No.\" I won\\'t say it\\'s even better because I don\\'t know if a lot of my friends work on those shows, but it\\'s really good, it\\'s just as good. And I started sharing that with them, and then lo and behold, I suddenly had players and I started exercising all of those skills, just a couple of weeks into \"Critical Role\" airing because I started watching the show and my passion was just reignited. And then the rest is kind of history, so.\\xa0But when I was... I just love YouTube. And I was constantly typing into the search engine \"D&D game play,\" \"D&D game play,\" found the (indistinct) cast doing it a little bit, still wanted more, and eventually one day this thing called \"Critical Role\" popped up. And I was able to start talking about it to people because I could say, \"Hey, have you seen this show? Have you seen it?\" And they\\'re like, \"What, are you talking about \\'Avatar',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh my God, what a story, what a tale. I love too that you… first, there's so many things that I want to say to that, first of all, shout out to Upstate New York, yeah. Other than getting milkshakes at Stewart's, there's not too much going on-\",\n"," ' Wegmans.',\n"," '\\xa0Wegmans, yes. (laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0All of the good Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. There's so many, there's so many things.\",\n"," ' Just the landmarks that I\\'ve seen, but you\\'re very right. God, the dependency on rides, it\\'s just like, \"Oh, how do we get a ride?\" Also all of the late night diner runs, \\'cause it\\'s like, there\\'s no other place for us to even be physically in the world right now.',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, yeah, the amount of things that occurred within the family diners of... they all hated us because we also showed up in glitter and costume. And did I dress up for every \"Harry Potter\" movie before it was cool? I\\'m not saying that I didn\\'t, but also remember I was weird.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yes, 100%, everyone knows the corner booth at the diner. It got to the point where there was a back room to the New Paltz Plaza diner, where it's like, these kids are gonna come in, they're gonna be covered in grease paint and glitter from LARPing. Just shove them in the back corner as far from the regular customers, dear God. But hey, you know what? We were regulars, too, we supported the local diner.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, well, we only got it half off when it was 4.99 for the boneless buffalo wings. But we tipped, well, at least 20%, it wasn't hard on 4.99, but we tipped 20%.\",\n"," \" 100%, yeah, it took us 30 minutes to figure out the tip, 'cause a bunch of teenagers trying to do that math at three o'clock in the morning, but what we're going to say, we're gonna pat-\",\n"," \" You know what, that's how I knew I was a dungeon master. I always took the receipt and I always broke it down and I knew I was destined, so it was even before we played.\",\n"," '\\xa0That\\'s what I want to talk about, is it\\'s such a beautiful thing. Like you\\'re saying, there\\'s this moment of... I think that a lot of dungeon masters have that awakening in themselves where they go, \"Man, I\\'m having a hard time finding a dungeon master out here.\" And then they have that little moment of being called to service of like, \"Well, damn. If I\\'m having a hard time finding a dungeon master, I guess everyone else is too, I\\'m looking around here, I\\'m not seeing anyone stepping up. I\\'m going to step up,\" that\\'s so wonderful. And talk to me a little, when was that first time that you were like, I want to play and I want to play so badly that I will take the sort of onus on myself of starting a game, getting players, either getting a module or homebrewing my own campaign world, what was that process like, the first time you were sitting down to the head of the table.',\n"," '\\xa0It was intimidating, and I made a lot of mistakes. I\\'m not gonna lie. I at first put the feelers out and was hunting for somebody online, and I was just like, \"Hey, can we connect?\" \\'Cause we were all talking about it through some online groups and I just reached out. I was like, \"Hey, who can do this? We have 15 people who want to play, how do we make this happen?\" And then everyone was kind of dancing in circles. And I just said, \"You know what, I\\'ll do it. Give me a month, let me work on this. I won\\'t say it\\'s going to be great right away or good in any capacity, but I want to start somewhere.\" And with that, I kind of went into overachiever study mode. I was an overachiever in high school. We don\\'t have to talk about just how much of a nerd I was. But when you have no friends, you put it into school and you take all of your lunch hours and study hall periods and you just fill it with classes. So I was one of those kids, so let\\'s overachieve. So I just went in and I read, I read the manual over and over and over again. I watched as much online play as I could. I studied a lot and did a lot of resource work on forgotten realms because I thought to myself, I\\'m not going to try to homebrew, but if I can master the Forgotten Realms and the lore and the history of it to essentially make it canonized within my own head, then I can apply that within the story and sandbox this in a way where there are certain things, but people can make choices and then I can kind of react and build from there. And it was definitely an experiment. It was a lot of stumbling as I began, and I actually started with \"Fourth Edition\" modules built within \"5E\" worlds because I liked the mechanics of \"5E,\" but I think some of the \"4E\" storytelling was so rich, and I really wanted to latch onto that and build from there, so that one day I could step into the more updated storylines and really, I don\\'t know, embrace them and understand where they came from. So as I was kind of exercising all of that, I did make the mistake of inviting the other 14 people to play for the first time. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0No, Kelly, you had 14 people playing at your first table? (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Ask any of them, that is true.',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh my God, that's beautiful and epic. And also I feel so sorry for Kelly of a long time ago. That's a lot of work.\",\n"," '\\xa0I learned the hard way for a bit, but it was also so exciting \\'cause I kind of understood how to spotlight people and balance different characters and needs. And eventually, once we played every few weeks, some folks were like, \"This is a bit too much for me.\" But we had our core group within about a few months of playing. We had a normal eight people playing, normal? Eight, (laughs) eight to seven people playing. And we played a game for almost a year and it was absolutely magical. They made a lot of choices that were strong. And I learned as a DM that you can build so much. Oh, you can build the world, you can build the stories. But it\\'s not about that, it is about listening and reacting, and that was amazing. Also coming from improv, being able to implement all those skills and start to free myself and my narrative a bit more.',\n"," \"\\xa0Well, I love that too, because you are somebody who can really speak to the skillset of being a dungeon master because your career is thismulti-talent career of, you've written for animation, you've done improv, you've written musicals, you have a musical theater background. And I also love, too, when you say the thing of musical theater connecting to D&D, I know, from a pop culture standpoint, why that seems like a huge jump. But having played myself and coming from a LARP background, that high drama, loving of showmanship and entertainment and storytelling for its own sake, I get 100% why those two links would come together. So looking at, in the constellation of types of storytelling and types of performance you have done, where do you see tabletop and Dungeons & Dragons sort of lying? I love what you just said, because I've even said on the podcast before, sometimes I think that you want to avoid looking at that dungeon master position as a full fledged storyteller, because there is so much of it that actually is... you don't want to veer into the auteur status that sometimes comes with that. Where do you see tabletop lying in the constellation of your other talents, performances, and mediums that you work in?\",\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s storytelling and specifically within the TTRPG world. It is its own medium, it truly is. You understand, coming from improv backgrounds, coming from musical theater, each one of these are a tool for us to tell our stories or to tell stories together. But that together part is the most interesting part of it because in musical theater and pre-scripted writing, animation, live action, things like that, we come together and then we build the story, and then we invite others into it, and we all sort of make it our world together that way. With D&D, everyone\\'s agency is a bit different. The ownership is a bit different and the trust is so much more raw. I really think if you can create a really beautiful experience at the table with a game, you can do anything. I think it\\'s the most incredible tool, much like improv being such a phenomenal tool as well. I love improv because there are certain games you can implement. You can do all these different sorts of styles and mind melding with people and creating that comedy in those beats, so much richness can come from that. So much freedom within yourself and others, and really cool idea generation that you can kind of sink into and bring forward, or character works for actors. For D&D you can get that. But because of the rule set, that is a bit more strict in ways, but I would just say that there\\'s stronger rail, there\\'s a stronger railroad track to go down, and you\\'re still choosing whatever destination you want together, but you\\'re building, you\\'re literally building the actual train (laughs) as you\\'re driving it, that\\'s the difference. Everywhere else, you got the train and you\\'re going, you already know what your cargo is. With D&D, are just like building it together, and you\\'re kind of the conductor, saying, \"Okay, we\\'re going this, okay-\"(laughing drowns out speaker)',\n"," '\\xa0\"Oh, gosh, could somebody please feed Tommy, he\\'s dying.\" It\\'s kind of like that, and that\\'s what makes it so special, is that trust, because you don\\'t know where you\\'re going, but you know you\\'re going somewhere. And if you can implement that style of storytelling to trust within one another, with the gameplay, then you can... that will carry over to other areas in your life. And it\\'s a skill set that I honestly... and the reason why it\\'s so enriching is because it\\'s as real as a story that you tell on a 2D surface. You have these experiences together and you can talk with your friend Brianna, and you can be like, \"Brianna, remember that time you slayed that dragon, and you licked the sword\\'s blood, and it was just... you remember that?\" And you can be like, \"Yeah,\" while you\\'re at a wedding. It\\'s just-(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0That's the magic of it. That's the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in comparison to the other modes of storytelling you're talking, removed. That's why musical theater and D&D are so close. You're inviting the audience into share an experience, an emotional moment together, and in D&D that fourth wall is removed. You're all there and you're in it.\",\n"," '\\xa0Yes, right, it\\'s that idea of, you can put improv and tabletop together, and then take other things like writing, whether you\\'re writing for comics or you\\'re writing for television, you\\'re writing a novel, because I think that one of the main things... back when I was teaching improv, I would always say one of the hardest thing for artists coming from another medium to do when they get into improv is to remove your instinct to edit, to go like, \"Okay, can this be perfected?\" And it\\'s very hard to have, especially in... I\\'d even said to people like, listen, I wrote, I was a DM writer at a LARP camp for a long time. There are a lot of moments where, as a writer... sometimes I think within improv, there\\'s this idea of like, never say no, never edit. That works for improv, but it doesn\\'t mean that editing is bad. It\\'s good to have a perfectionist spirit. If you\\'re working on a script, it should be tight. You should have it be pretty polished and have it be good to go, right? This is only gonna exist one time. With improv and tabletop, you get into that similar sphere of, we are completely removing the instinct to alter. The first draft is the last draft. And instead of editing and perfecting and polishing, we are going to bring in this other thing where we perfect something by honoring it exactly as it happened. And that\\'s how we\\'re gonna-',\n"," '\\xa0Exactly.',\n"," \" That's how we're going to perfect it. But I love what you just said, because I think that is a difference for me between improv and especially... a little bit different with actual play. But with the games is, when you're doing improv, there's still always this idea of, this is presentational, it's for the audience, right? In tabletop, you and your friends at the table are the primary audience. And as a result of that, you're also doing this thing, which you're definitely not doing in long form improv, which is you are inviting a collaborator to the table that are these collections of pretty little polyhedral gemstone math rocks.(Kelly laughs)\",\n"," \"\\xa0And they're a collaborator with you, which unlike an improv means there is a, a helper at the table with us who is gonna help us with this story that has no affiliation with human wants or desires. (laughs) It is just here to reflect chance and circumstance, which makes the storytelling so thrilling because you realize that one of the storytellers is not moved by friendship with the other people at the table, or human biases. It's like really anything can happen, which is extremely dramatic and wonderful. I wanted to also jump into something with you if I could, which was, so starting with this amazing 14 person game, jumping into this regularly-\",\n"," \"\\xa0Amazing, that's a strong word, I like it.(both laughing)\",\n"," \"\\xa0I just know for me, I don't know if… our audience maybe has not run games personally. I'm just thinking of the pure heft of getting that game. There's just nothing but respect for even successfully running a 14 person, that is a feat of creative strength and stamina that I can only (claps) just-\",\n"," '\\xa0Thank you, thank you.',\n"," ' But I wanted to ask too, the trends... so a lot of the guests that we\\'ve had on \"Adventuring Academy\" have come into D&D with sort of a... started two years ago, three years ago, four years ago. As someone who has been playing this game since adolescence much like me, that you start, you found it when you were high school age, when you were a teenager, what has been your experience watching the ascendancy of not only D&D, but all these tabletops and actual play as a performance genre? What has that been like for you?',\n"," '\\xa0I mean, oh, gosh, absolutely freeing, (laughs) freeing, because it was always something that I felt, I never feel... shame is not something that I want to feel ever, but I felt like I had to be quiet about it. Like it was something that wasn\\'t... that it\\'s something that I could be judged about, I could be judged on. And that was hard for me, especially being a woman and being native. You\\'re treading on thin ice already. And the idea of having to get bullied more or having to deal with people\\'s energies more when you\\'re just like this, isn\\'t helping anybody, this is not conducive. Why are you judging me? This energy is better spent maybe on yourself, (laughs) where is this coming from? I was just tiptoeing more and hoping and praying that it would have its day, it would have its moment, its freedom. And to see it kind of become this wave of... it\\'s more than just a game for a lot of people. When you\\'re playing a standard game, and you\\'re just, I dunno, around a gaming table, playing a million of board games that I have, which I\\'m also obsessed with and I love deeply, it gives you a totally different feeling than that of TTRPG. And it\\'s kind of like, you get hungry for it because you\\'re realizing you can be anything you want. There is a limitlessness to it. For those of us who grew up and were kind of enjoying all of these amazing fantasy stories that kind of hit us during the growth years, the retellings like \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Harry Potter,\" and all of these monolithic things, holding onto those and then saying, \"Wait a minute. I paint this in my own head with my friends and I can be anything I want to be in my head and I can make choices. I can play a guy and, oh, I can be a gnome.\" You just have these moments that you\\'re kind of able to grab onto, and seeing people instead of shying away from it and lean into it, it\\'s an awakening. And it\\'s not even... it\\'s like a renaissance in some ways, but I actually, I coined this term for myself from a young age and I call it a nascence, which just means birth in French because it\\'s not even a rebirth of old ideals. What we\\'re doing is we\\'re birthing something completely new with the tools that we\\'re given currently. And you\\'re still still paying homage and respect to what once existed, but now we\\'re making it for everybody. And it\\'s beyond just the game, it\\'s a tool for friendship. It\\'s a tool for closeness-ness, closeness-ness, closeness. There\\'s a lot of nesses in that one, just add a few more.(both laughing) ',\n"," \"\\xa0It's become its own genre, its own thing, rather than just lumped into one of the many board games that you pick up when you go to a board game cafe. And I can only see it growing and being used hopefully in every country around the world, and maybe high schools having that be implemented during study halls or using it at lunch tables, or using it for children who are trying to exercise their emotions and need to get it out in a conducive and healthy way, kids like me who played with Barbie dolls 'til they were 13 and were judged for it. I could've used it, so, yeah.\",\n"," '\\xa0I love that and yeah, I hear you. It\\'s very, well, it\\'s great. I feel like I had a, I also, I feel like I was… I was incredibly... I was up in those double digit years of age when I was like, \"Look, it\\'s time to just say what we\\'re all thinking. Santa Claus probably is not real.\"',\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) Probably?',\n"," \"\\xa0I'm not gonna... I won't qualify it as a certainty, but it seems to be that he's probably not real. But I think that there is that beautiful thing of how freeing the game can be. And I also love what you said too, that there are pieces of media that I have consumed passively that changed my life. However, the pieces of media that I have not only consumed, but been involved in the creation of them while I was consuming them, these stories that you create and perceive with your friends, because there's something beautiful about being a creator at the table while you're also still being a spectator that someone in their own private scene roles that nat 20 and the whole table of friends bursts from their seats, and (cheers) I can't believe it. It's this beautiful shared thing where it's like circular breathing. You are simultaneously being told a story and telling a story and it's just beautiful. It's life changing, and like you said, you're at a wedding somewhere and then you turn in your... you and I might be wearing suits right now. We killed a basilisk, and it's a huge deal. And it's crazy that no one's talking about it.\",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, yeah, definitely. (laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0It's beautiful, and a player on Dimension 20, Emily Axford, who's an incredible D&D player, she has often said an echo of what you just said, of these memories, being fictional, don't live in a different part of your heart than your first person real-world memories. Yes, it's a story, but I remember the dread as the dice was rolling in my hand and remember the relief when it hit that number it needed to hit. And it is a first person story, even for being fictional. And you remember those moments, they really, really shape you. It's so beautiful and enriching. I wanted to also talk about, speaking of those personal storytellers, I want to talk a little bit about the awesome actual plays you've been involved in-\",\n"," ' Oh, yeah, please.',\n"," '\\xa0Yes, absolutely, \"Girls Guts Glory,\" an incredible actual play. I remember seeing you guys up in the news, it\\'s a stream that everybody should check out if you haven\\'t already, Kelly is an incredible DM. And I also wanted to talk about ND&D, which has not appeared yet.',\n"," '\\xa0No, not yet. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Not yet, but oh, baby, does it sound incredibly exciting. Talk a little bit about your journey with moving from a dungeon master into a in front of camera dungeon master and what that was like.',\n"," ' It was a really special experience. \"Girls Guts Glory,\" they are my girls, they are my hearts and we are, and the beautiful thing is too, is that everybody within it is so talented right now, Rachel Seeley is running their current, their current sort of season. And it\\'s incredible just because, if you can\\'t tell, I\\'m doing way too much at the moment, (laughs) and I\\'m going to be returning down the line. But being able to be a part of their collective, be a part of their group has a really unique and interesting beginning just because I was just playing Dungeons & Dragons, trying to become this better storyteller with 14 people and ended up running this game for a year and exercising and getting, becoming the best DM I possibly could. Flash forward a couple of years later, I ended up meeting somebody by sheer luck at an event who happened to work at Geek & Sundry, and they invited me to come hang out on Friday nights, which is how I know Erika Ishii and (indistinct) and all these amazing-',\n"," '\\xa0I love Erika, yes.',\n"," ' Oh, I love Erika, too. And that\\'s where I met these two girls who had just happened to be there the same night and we were talking and they mentioned, out of the blue, \"Yeah, we\\'re looking for a new DM.\" And I said, \"Well, I\\'m a dungeon master and I\\'ve never played with all women. You guys sound really cool, can we play?\" And they said, \"Yeah, let\\'s do it.\" And so I brought them over to my house with that beautiful table that I hand built with all of my friends. I\\'m very proud of the table. Richard Donner built a beautiful table, and shouts out to Richard. But there\\'s this table, and they sat around and I told this story that I\\'ve always, I got to exercise a little bit of a different part of me sitting down at that table with all women. It just, I had never had that feeling and it just changed it, it just changed the moment for me because I said, \"Oh, I\\'m gonna breathe a little bit easier here.\" Knowing some stuff, just knowing that my former teams, I love them to pieces, but maybe they\\'re gonna play differently. Maybe they\\'re going to think differently. Maybe they\\'re going to want to do certain things differently by approaching some... and it was true. They wanted to do more talking. They kind of wanted to do more of the role playing. And I said, \"This is so exciting. Let\\'s keep leaning into this.\" And lo and behold, that first day we all played, afterwards they\\'re like, \"We gotta keep you. You\\'re joining our team for a part of \\'Girls Guts Glory.\\' We have one season that exists already or a thing that exists, do you want to join us?\" And I was just like, (laughs) \"Yes, yes.\" That\\'s how it kind of happened. Magic, sheer magic. And from there, I got to play with the women and I got to, I was so nervous when I first started. I just, I had never live streamed. And as a DM, I was shaking in the first few episodes, I was so nervous. But eventually I sunk into it and found the pattern and was able to introduce the storyline. And it was so engaging, seeing the way they reacted to the storytelling and the characters of the world. And I just, I am so proud to be a part of their legacy and be a part of who and what these women are and have them in my life. I mean, one of them is one of my closest friends. Like we all... it\\'s been a beautiful experience. They are my sisters. That then relays to me joining the second sister, but as a player, which was totally different for \"Sirens of the Realm,\" playing as Fey Lore with Satine, which is still and was incredible, but it\\'s very different coming from a player\\'s perspective. And I kind of wanted to swing back into the DM space after running a couple of games, like \"Tales from the Loop\" and doing a few things with G&S, I said, \"What am I missing?\" \\'Cause \"Girls Guts Glory\" gave me so much by letting me set a table and constantly let me play with these... what am I, I was like, you know what? I\\'ve always wanted a table full of Indians. What a beautiful thing. And I want to do it, and how do I do it? I just will it into the world. So I just contacted some of my friends who I had met over the years who are incredible comedians and insane writers, people who should be household names. These people should be recognized by people because we don\\'t have that. Our community doesn\\'t have that. Our community needs representation more than ever, because quite literally, we\\'re not represented anywhere correctly, pretty much 99% of the time, unless we write our own stories. So what could it start to look like? I was like, well, let\\'s start with D&D, let\\'s start in a space where there\\'s no money and there\\'s no person above saying no, there\\'s no regulations. And we can just take this multimillion dollar budget in our heads and these characters that we want to build, however we want, and we can play at a table and we can exist together. So that way we simply say we exist. We\\'ve only met together a couple of times to build our characters, but it has been like, I want to cry after we play because it\\'s so moving. And it\\'s so powerful for me to see this, this healing and see this beauty and celebrate what we are. It\\'s just, I never thought I would see it. And I just hope we see more and more of it. I hope it creates a space for more people to be recognized. I\\'m gonna get choked up thinking about it. Yeah, it\\'s hard. I\\'m not as articulate when I talk about it because I\\'m like, oh, emotions.',\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) It sounds, I mean, it seems completely correct to get choked up over it. It sounds beautiful, I cannot wait to support the stream, and-',\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s chaotic, they\\'re all chaos, they\\'re so chaotic. I think one or two of them are like, \"You guys, maybe we shouldn\\'t.\" And then they\\'re all like. (imitates yelling)(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Jumping off tables, singing songs.',\n"," \" Oh, God, that's.\",\n"," \"\\xa0It's beautiful though because they're all new players. I get to guide them on this bond with the skills that I have with this lack of judgment and give them this tool and the space to... it's just, so I hope to God one day we can bring this, the creator and God himself, all of them have mixed together. I hope we can bring this to, to reservations and to kids on the Rez who could use a little bit of positivity and storytelling and freedom within those spaces that we're receiving. So let's echo that, everybody, let's get some kids on Rezes to play some D&D. Mobilize.(both laughing)\",\n"," '\\xa0That is so beautiful, and I think, yes, if you\\'re watching this, any Dimension 20 fans, I\\'m not sure when this episode will come out in relation to when \"ND&D\" is gonna be coming out, you are honor bound if you watch Dimension 20 to go check out \"ND&D,\" honor bound.(Kelly laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0I will, as Kelly has willed through the table and through \"Girls Guts Glory,\" through all these willing of things to be, I will, all of you, please go check out this stream ASAP. But what you\\'re saying is really beautiful because it\\'s one of those things where, look, I don\\'t want to be overly romantic because the truth is that some people take these games and tell stories with it that are not deeply self-affirming of souls and values and yada yada. ',\n"," '\\xa0[laughing] Yeah, they just do it for fun, they just, yeah.',\n"," '\\xa0Plenty of people who pick it up and they\\'re like, \"Excuse me, I would like to kill some gorgons, thank you,\" and then check out. And if that\\'s what you get out of it, then all the best. But there is something in tabletop gaming that is so deeply and profoundly life affirming and affirming of something, and I don\\'t think-',\n"," ' The storytelling, that\\'s the need that\\'s... we are the OG, we\\'re the original storytellers. We are the people on Turtle Island who began the stories. We tell stories orally, we sit around, my tribe, sat around a fire within the winter season. And we would talk within long houses and we would share the stories. And those stories are just as real and just as enriching as D&D. And so to see other people doing it, it\\'s like, \"You\\'re doing what we do.\" Like welcome, (laughing drowns out speaker) right?',\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s great, it\\'s incredible. You\\'re absolutely right, 100%. And there is a beautiful invitation, especially when you can create a table. And what you\\'re saying is, you\\'re talking about freedom, right, because having a table of all women invites freedom, invites you the freedom to play, as you\\'re saying, with a certain amount of like, breathe out, exhale. And I can, again, I can only imagine. But the power of having that table and setup in that way to be like, we\\'re gonna tell a type of story, and you can be as free as possible. And again, passive consumption of storytelling has definitely had life-changing impacts for me, but there is some… I think like when you talk about the explosion, the nascence, if you will, of this type of storytelling into the public sphere, I think, yes, you can, there\\'s a couple things you have to credit, which is the lowered barrier for entry of podcasting and live streaming. That\\'s definitely a part of it. The success of actual plays like \"Critical Role\" is a huge part of it and bringing it to people. But I do... there\\'s a little romantic part of me that says any time period in which there are large forces at work, asking you to confirm your identity through your kind of allegiance to your passive consumption of certain things, be it music or pop culture, whatever. And again, yes, there are a lot of games that are themselves brands, but the story you create at the table is unique to you and your friends. And I think there is something really powerful about the ability to be like, yes, yes, yes. We love these stories, but also you and I know that we share a story that is ours and ours alone, and we made it together. There\\'s something really powerful about that. When you are sitting down to create a story, whether it was during the seasons of \"Girls Guts Glory\" that you DM, or whether it\\'s now as you are doing character creation and gearing up to launch this new \"ND&D.\" Do you find your prep, this is not even a great question for people-',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, I love this. I love how specific this is, yeah.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah 'cause we have a lot of viewers who might be gearing up to DM for the first time. Or maybe they're gonna go for a table of all women, or they're gearing up for a table that there is a specific viewpoint. There's going to be a freedom at that table. What is some... how do you approach your prep work, vis-a-vis these different games that you've actually played?\",\n"," \"\\xa0It's such a great question because that's where it all begins, right? It's like, okay, so what's the catalyst, what's going to start the storytelling and what's going on in the world that is prevalent or needs to be addressed at some point? Even if you're sandboxing or if you're doing like a straight story, how do they interweave and how do we build this together? And that's, again, the word together is where I always start. I start with not myself and my own stories, but I start by listening to what they're doing. So it's never me at first. Maybe I'll choose a world at least, or maybe I'll choose a general of location to start. But that's about as far as I go, I'll wait to begin a kind of generic quest maybe where they can kind of buff up and get some cool trinkets. But what I'm really doing is listening to how they navigate and the sort of stories they're sharing with one another. I want their friend's stories and their backstories. I want that session zero, so that way I can plan out the world kind of around them, which is a little insane for some people. But I think that is way more engaging to... why make it some villain when you can make it the ex husband of the paladin?\",\n"," \"\\xa0(laughs) Yes, you are preaching the true gospel. This is exactly what our… if you're listening to this, I think this is absolutely on the money. Building your story as an affirmation of what your PCs have already chosen develops a world that, as your PCs explore it, they will feel innately connected to it because it's based off of their choices, 100%. And I love what you said too about like not giving to, I think exactly what you're saying. You give them a world, but that's kind of like to use the... this is a weird metaphor, excuse me. But like, it's almost like a conductor giving a key, like we're all getting this key, but I'm not gonna... I don't know what instruments you're bringing yet. I'm just going to give you this. Then we'll figure out what's happening. And this is maybe a terrible musical analogy, but, but there's that idea of, I'm gonna give you a little tone setting, a little bit of, here's kind of a loose idea to inspire so that you're not just making your character off of a blank page. And then after that, we're gonna really get into the nitty gritty together, and that's beautiful. So launching into that, that idea of incorporating your players' choices, what are the type of choices that players make to get you really excited? What are the things that they do? And you're like, great. Like ex-husband for the paladin, got it.\",\n"," '\\xa0I love it when they make mistakes. (Brennan laughs) ',\n"," '\\xa0And if they don\\'t make mistakes, I love it when the dice rolls, make it for them. I think the best story comes from flawed characters. I try to explain this to people sometimes when I say, \"Don\\'t be afraid, there\\'s no winning in D&D, so don\\'t be afraid to let your character\\'s flaws determine and have results because that\\'s where really rich storytelling will come out.\" When you watch something like \"Riverdale,\" are you watching it for all the outside characters that come in that die off in one episode? No, you\\'re watching it for the drama between Veronica and Archie and Betty. You want that juice, you want that drama. You want them to make bad choices. Will they, won\\'t they, you want all that. And to set that up, the freedom of saying, \"Don\\'t be afraid to do things like splitting the party if it makes sense, don\\'t be afraid to do things and story tell when the other characters are aware, they can\\'t hear that. Or they don\\'t actually know what\\'s going on.\" There\\'s a certain level of trust as we go around the table to kind of stretch into those arenas. I remember there was... one of my favorite moments was a few years back. One of our Druids, (laughs) his name was Leaf, he was just wading through some murky waters, some swamps, and they had killed a homebrew version of a shambling mound. And they\\'re going through this and they killed it, and as you know, a shambling mound, it turns into a twig that\\'s enchanted that eventually grows again. So he doesn\\'t like to see plant and earth things destroyed. So after they destroyed the shambling mound, he ate it.[pause] ',\n"," ' Oh. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0As an octopus.(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0And that meant that the rest of that session, I had to Google the interior of an octopus, because who needs chambers or actual dungeons when you have the inside of an octopus to go through? [laughing] So yes, essentially it was like a \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,\" where everybody had to, like-',\n"," '\\xa0Oh my God.',\n"," '\\xa0Get all the characters through a giant octopus to try to find a shambling mound stick, yeah. So that was like one of the best characters that, what a character moment, what a great character moment that ended up being one of the best sessions ever because of a flawed character making a strong choice. (laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0God, that's so good. But what I want to underline there too is there's something in that scene you've described that is a perfect EG for what dungeon masters need to do. 'Cause there's two things, there's a balance, right? Enforce consequences, because consequences are storytelling. Something happened and it led to something else. It's not a sequence of random events. It's a sequence of events that follow as the journey continues, right? The step follows the step immediately preceding it. And so it's consequences, which we need, but there has to be playfulness. There has to be playfulness because one thing is that I think is a holdover of a crunchier, less kind, spirited holdover from incarnations of the game in the distant past, which would be, consequences are a moment to play gotcha and deeply punish your players.\",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, yeah, I get that, yeah.',\n"," '\\xa0Which is the thing that you have to balance because I think that it\\'s very possible… there is a golden mean here because on the one hand there\\'s a, \"Oh, you ate the twig? The shambling mound blows up in your stomach and now you\\'re dead, now you\\'re a big patch of mulch. You dumb octopus, how dare you,\" right?(Kelly laughs) ',\n"," '\\xa0And then the other half is the thing of like, \"Oh, you eat the twig, cool, you eat the twig. Nothing happens, it\\'s all okay.\" Which, as you can see, is maybe very kind, but what does it do, it doesn\\'t create story. And there\\'s something beautiful about like, I am going to hold you to your action. You\\'ve eaten an enchanted twig. This was maybe ill-advised, but what is the cure for this ill-advised thing? More story, more story is the cure, which is like the exact perfect example of, I think, how to satisfy both those desires in storytelling. And I think that\\'s, to look at that another way, as well, is that thing... because I think what the downsides are to both paths are, if everything is always okay, the story loses its stakes and your players begin to go... sometimes when you push on the world, what you want is resistance.',\n"," '\\xa0You do, yes, 100%. That\\'s what... they want to feel. I have had so many sessions with players coming in and they\\'ve had a bad day and they say, \"I gotta kill something today.\" You know what I do, I look at my notes and I say, \"They\\'re going to kill something today.\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0I do it, I do it for them. They don\\'t need to know that, I hope they\\'re not listening, but also I\\'m gonna do it for them because that is true, there needs to be that pushback. There needs to be that resistance. There needs to be that feeling of, \"I can do it, I did it\" sometimes, it\\'s very important.',\n"," '\\xa0100%, and I love that feeling. And you go too far in the other direction, you end up with these moments of like, let\\'s say someone eats the twig and you just kill them, right? What you have done then… I think the important thing is there is almost like a mirroring the dance exercise between dungeon master and players. If you show for them, because the dungeon master is fundamentally like a physics engine and also a consequence engine for the world. If you show them, \"Hey, you ate the twig. You did, you did a fun, big choice. Check this out, you\\'re dead.\" Don\\'t be surprised when the next adventure rolls around and you go, \"A robed stranger invites you into a Gothic carriage and says, \\'I have a proposition for you,\\'\" And all your players go, \"We shoot him. Nope, don\\'t trust him, he\\'s bad. We don\\'t listen to the stranger, in fact, we run. I Wild Shape into a bird, I fly away.\" And you\\'re going, how come my PCs won\\'t take my adventure hooks? And they\\'re like, they won\\'t take them because you\\'re not playful.',\n"," ' There was a break of trust. There\\'s the breaching of trust, which is so delicate, and I think that there\\'s also some times the stigma that people shouldn\\'t talk about it. And I think the healthiest tables do talk about it. Let\\'s say you do make one of those choices. There\\'s so many options, so many choices with this twig situation that it could have gone so many different directions. And if a choice or a mistake is made, that\\'s where the real discussion begins. That\\'s where the real trust is made outside of the table, around the table, saying, \"Hey, you guys, I made this bad choice. I\\'m going to modify it, can we talk about it?\" No person is perfect. I\\'ve had to have those moments where I\\'ve pulled people aside and said, \"Hey, are you okay, what\\'s going on?\" And we\\'ve talked through it and it\\'s been okay at the end of the day, but you never know what somebody\\'s going through. So that\\'s just such a great example of both of those, of being like it can\\'t… there are certain tables that can have that. It is your job and your duty as a dungeon master to help begin those discussions, it really is.',\n"," \" I really agree in holding that space for people is again, part of... because you are in this head of the table position, you're trying to hold that space for people as much as possible, because, I think we've said this on the podcast before, but moments of charged emotion are going to come up because you wouldn't be enjoying this if you didn't care. And caring means that there are strong emotions attached to things. And it's not about never having those moments of like, Oh, an expectation wasn't met or need wasn't met. Those are going to occur, even in the healthiest groups of friends. It's about, how do we address it when it inevitably comes up, it has to be addressed in a healthy way. Kelly, we're flying a timeline. I just looked up at the clock and was like, huh. So we got to get to questions, we have-\",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, yes, ask the questions, go. Come at me, and I’ll bat ‘em!',\n"," ' (laughs) Here\\'s a great one. This one is from a Claudia Art Deco. Thanks, Claudia Art Deco. \"Where do you draw your fantasy inspiration as a D&D player or writer? Do you have any must reads?\"',\n"," '\\xa0Ooh, that\\'s such a good question. Must reads. I really like some of the Forgotten Realms books that you can get that have existed for some time. You can just Google them, they\\'re around, some of the Drizzt stuff, there\\'s just, there\\'s a trove of fun fantasy within the D&D space that I think even if you don\\'t play within Forgotten Realms, or even if you play a different TTRPG, learning that and seeing people tell the storybook form-wise or even graphic novel-wise or comic book-wise, it\\'s very exciting, and I\\'ve gotten a lot of resources and inspiration from those. In terms of other material, I do a very interesting thing when I watch and consume almost anything, television, films, books, whatever, it may be musicals. I watch it, and then I think to myself, what do I like? And what do I enjoy about this? And I think that\\'s where a lot of my storytelling comes from, which is sort of like, well, that was exciting, what do I like about it? And then I maybe just let that thought exist in my head and I don\\'t think on it too much. And then one day down the road, when you\\'re making notes or trying to come up with a world, you say, \"Oh, I really want to do a mushroom kingdom,\" that came from somewhere. Don\\'t remember where, but this is my version of it. And then you just create it, and just feeling that and having those thoughts percolate and not putting too much pressure on yourself. I think it\\'s where, especially if you\\'re homebrewing, that\\'s where really great ideas and worlds can come from.',\n"," \"\\xa0I think that is wonderful. Especially looking at the old... there's two things I want to say in reaction to that, that I think. Number one, I love going back and looking at the old Forgotten Realm stuff, looking at the old-\",\n"," \"\\xa0It's so good.\",\n"," '\\xa0I was a huge... me and my brother were obsessed with the \"Planescape\" setting. Tony DiTerlizzi did the art for it. You guys might know Tony DiTerlizzi\\'s art, he also illustrated \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\" books. He\\'s an incredible, incredible artist. And the books were just so well designed. And one of things I loved about those books too that I wanted to bring back in a big way is a huge percentage of those books, the information about the setting was diegetic to characters from the world, so you had this fun of, everybody\\'s an unreliable narrator. So this is a description of the Upper Plains of Mount Celestia and Arborea, given by a demon. So it\\'s like, [in a slightly deeper rascally voice] \"There\\'s a shining silvery sea. It burns you terribly, awful, stay away.\" [normal voice] And this is beautiful. (both laughing) ',\n"," ' And I just love that world building of diegetic world building, so it\\'s sort of like, we\\'re not giving you any ex cathedra authorial, \"Here\\'s what the world is like.\" You\\'ll determine from what people in the world have to say about it, which is so fun. But I think that within that, if you\\'re a beginning dungeon master, one thing, hearing you say, \"Go back to the Forgotten Realms,\" go back and look at those old Drizzt stuff, The \"Dragonlance\" novels I remember had-',\n"," ' Oh, yeah, those, oh my goodness, yeah.',\n"," '\\xa0Is, you go back and look at those. When you\\'re starting a game for the first time, I have this thing, \\'cause I\\'ve been doing Dimension 20, which are all these sort of comedic world swap mishmash mix them up kind of settings, that when I start a game, I just built up a tolerance to classic high fantasy. So I\\'ll sit down with new players and be like, \"So what do we want to do? Do we want to do like spell jammer ships, but everybody\\'s, it\\'s like 1980s and we\\'re all drug dealers, but it\\'s in the Underdark, do we want to do this?\" And people... if you\\'re playing with new players, someone maybe has never gotten to be a fairy princess, or has never gotten to be a dwarven warhammer guy. And you\\'re like, maybe they wanted their whole life to just be that, and this is an okay thing to let them do, even if you\\'re on some next level world building tip. And I think the other thing too there is, like you\\'re saying, getting your inspiration from anywhere is so fun. And again, there is so much creativity, which is, here\\'s an archetype I love, how do I put my spin on it, right?',\n"," '\\xa0Yes, yes, 100%.',\n"," '\\xa0Like, what\\'s your mushroom kingdom? Are you going to do elves, are you going to do them in a way that they\\'ve never been done before, right? There are these ideas that you can go back and revisit and go, \"What is my take on them?\" And I think that that\\'s... you are, when you\\'re building the world, even if it\\'s your very first time, you are the authority at the table. And if there\\'s something you can take from the canon, but I think you should never be working for the canon, like once, take exactly what you want to take, and then make it your own \\'cause it\\'s just going to exist there at the table with you and your friends.',\n"," \"\\xa0Exactly, it's tools, it's tools to you. So use them, but don't rely on them, definitely build from yourself and your own. You'll get so much more out of it if you start there.\",\n"," '\\xa0100%. This next one is from Aiden. Thank you, Aiden. Aiden asks, \"I\\'m a librarian who loves tabletop and bringing gaming to patrons, but DMing for folks who don\\'t know each other is a different beast. Any tips for bonding kids together to reduce player to player strife and promote teamwork? Love y\\'all so much.\" Well, thanks, Aiden, and yeah. I\\'m really flashing back to that 14 person table. Yeah, how often have you played with... playing with people for the first time, or in some cases, like you\\'re talking with \"Girls Guts Glory,\" it\\'s a preexisting group and you are the person who\\'s walking in, introducing yourself for the first time. What are some tips for bringing people that haven\\'t played together into the collaborative spirit of the game?',\n"," \"\\xa0I really enjoy that good session zero, which is less about, yes, it's just less about the story at first and a little bit more about, okay, so, who and what are we within this world to one another, and how did we meet each other and where do our stories come from? Some people can just start playing with the motive and you can start with preexisting modules. And you can use a lot of those prompts as a means to kind of find the ties, but they do at times still feel like individualistic ties. And I still think there's an important element to create the layers within your party dynamics, so no matter what, especially if you don't have time or if you're just playing a quick game, I think making or establishing some people as best friends, as sisters, cousins, coworkers, just starting to talk a little bit about that and create bonds and talk about, okay, so how did you know each other? Let's talk about one latch memory you guys have that you always make fun of, that nobody else is privy to. And so you can kind of exercise that and use that as a way to create a healthier party dynamic for younger kids. I also feel that as a young kid, they get very excited, and it's kinda like a fairy, in that they can… fairies have one emotion and they just sometimes want to do the one emotion. That good old prefrontal cortex. So I think that also using a session zero as a means to begin sort of a fun, not too high stakes, where they have to all do something together to fight something, some sort of threat. So really thinking about, what sort of enemy or situation can I introduce that would help get them all on the same page and require each one of their efforts to get this enemy out of the way, in whatever sort of way. I think either one of those directions is a smart move, especially if you're strapped on time and working with younger kids.\",\n"," ' I think that is so profoundly helpful. There\\'s this funny thing, because for myself, I can clock in myself, even... I\\'ve been DMing since I was a 10-year-old kid, and even to this day, I\\'m like, \"Man, Brennan, you do that a lot.\" And that\\'s not great, (laughs) moments where I\\'m like, \"Look at these little foibles you keep making. You keep doing this thing, why do you keep doing that?\" And one of them is, there\\'s a part of me that\\'s like, you know what? No, anyone can make whatever character they want to make. And I will find a way to water slide all of you into being best buddies. It\\'s a challenge, I got to do it. I just... a friend of mine, Michael Saltzman, who\\'s a writer for \"Um, Actually,\" a question word from \"Um, Actually,\" it was awesome, awesome guy, great dungeon master, recently was just like, \"Hey, I\\'m thinking about starting up a campaign.\" And I was like, \"Cool, I would love to play and not have to DM.\" And he was like, \"Great, you\\'re all mercenaries. You guys come up with why you joined this mercenary company. It\\'s your first day working for the mercenary company.\" And I just went, \"Oh my God, that makes everything so easy.\"',\n"," '\\xa0What a simple prompt, right?',\n"," '\\xa0What a simple prompt. And there was no part of me that was like, \"But what about my character vision?\" There was no part of me that rankled at that. And I immediately was like, \"Brennan, you could totally just do that.\" Especially if you\\'re like a librarian, you\\'re running a game, you\\'re strapped for time. You can go to your players and go, \"Hey, you all get along and work together within that parameter. What do you want to do now?\" And it can be as concrete as, you are literally coworkers, or you can come in, I think, and just have that thing of putting your thumb on the scale during character creation. It is not tyrannical. You are not putting a burden on anybody to go, \"Hey, I am seeing in your character creation that you are making a character that is very antagonistic towards others. I won\\'t even disallow this, but why does your character make an excuse for these four other people? Because you do have to like them.\" It is okay to put those parameters on things, especially when you\\'re playing with kids.',\n"," '\\xa0Exactly, yeah. (laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, having inter-party conflict can work, but that's a tremendous amount of trust that has to exist between the real human beings at the table to make inner party conflict work.\",\n"," '\\xa0Exactly, it works a little bit further down the line once all that trust is really there.',\n"," '\\xa0Exactly, 100%-',\n"," '\\xa0100% agree. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Hell yeah, the one thing I\\'ll bring up too is, I\\'ll say even if you have electricity, there\\'s also the one little caveat I\\'d like to give, which is occasionally, if you get to a level of trust where you are like family to each other, sometimes you get to a point where you\\'re like, \"Well, we\\'re like family, so we don\\'t have to check in.\" We\\'re like, I know these people like the back of my hand. And it\\'s one of those things where it\\'s like, actually, even with those people every once in a while, check in. I remember doing an improv show in New York with my oldest and most beloved indie group, and we did a show after not performing for a year and a half. And we were like slapping each other in the face for tag outs, we were just like, do it. People would initiate a scene, and we would be like, what? No, and we were cracking ourselves up that we were like, we maybe trust each other so much that it has manifested in not treating each other well.(both laughing)',\n"," '\\xa0Moment of reflection. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Moment of reflection. So even for people that you love dearly like family, make sure that you, or family itself, make sure that you\\'re still checking in. This is... let\\'s see, we got some other... oh. So this is actually one that\\'s sort of interesting that relates back to Kelly, you were talking about before in your early days of D&D. This one\\'s from Katie L, \"I\\'m a new college student attending a private religious college. I really enjoy watching D&D actual plays, but I haven\\'t played in a campaign myself before and I\\'m a little nervous about how D&D will be received at this new school. How do I try to find a group to play with while also navigating making new friends and adjusting to college?\" Thanks, Katie L, yeah. This relates back to some stuff you were talking about in terms of, now we\\'re in this nascence, we\\'re in this big time where D&D is having this big moment. But I remember I was playing back in the day, my mom... there was satanic panic stuff back in the day. There\\'s Jack Chick tracks of the little comics and stuff like that. I think the attitudes, even in religious circles, have somewhat shifted in this day and age, but is there... I\\'m trying to think of good advice for finding a group. Back in those days when you had that dungeon master come up to you and be like, \"Hey, Kelly, it seems like.\" Yeah, but how do you find… and I think this more broadly, but how do you find a group? Yeah, it\\'s an interesting question. I would say that even if you are looking for an in-person group, the internet is still your friend.',\n"," '\\xa0Yes, exactly that. The internet, or starting with internet ins, whispering the internet ins around campus, saying, [covertly] \"Have you seen Dimension 20?” And they\\'ll be like, \"What is that?\" And you can be like, [playing with her ponytail] \"Oh, well, thanks for asking. Let me tell you about it,\" like that.',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, and the hair, the hair is a signal. The hair is definitely a signal as your, like getting those little keys across. There is the kind of speakeasy element about it. And again, but I also think that that is, whether you are being careful because there\\'s like a cultural element in the place where you are, whether you\\'re at a religious institution, you\\'re just, maybe you\\'re in a small town where the attitude is maybe not as cosmopolitan, whatever it is. I actually think that even... it\\'s a big deal to ask someone to join your D&D group, I feel like, because you\\'re like, \"Hey, do you want to commit to hanging out biweekly for the next,\" however long. I think that you can broach those things gingerly, like you\\'re saying, start up conversations about nerd adjacent, D&D-adjacent things. And again, I think a lot of, even if you\\'re like, I am interested in doing this at my college, is there a student group? Is there a group that you guys belong to, be it a Facebook thing, an email chain, whatever. Looking for those fellow travelers around you that are engaging in the same sort of media consumption that you are. And I think broaching it gingerly is an okay thing to do within those contexts. But I would also say look around because, especially if you\\'ve just joined this institution, there may be groups that are preexisting here that you don\\'t know about. I would like, do a little snooping around in those spaces to find like-minded individuals.',\n"," '\\xa0You might even find them at your local game store when and if the game store is reopened and people can actually interact then, that until then I would recommend doing online stuff. But that is where a lot of people, prior to having to move to more digital spaces, were also finding folks.',\n"," '\\xa0All right, that\\'s a great piece of advice. And also remember that your LGS probably has an online portal or avatar. They may have a little Facebook group. It may have something else like that. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dating myself here that I\\'ve mentioned in Facebook. (laughing drowns out speaker) All our gen Z fans are like, \"Facebook, what the hell are you talking about?\"',\n"," ' Neopets. Anyway.(both laughing)',\n"," \" Mine's called Little Sparky Spot Star. It was a Neopet, what's it called, stock market, and I was a rich Neopetian and I'll stop there. I had no friends, again. (laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, truly, in the animation world, I remember Molly Ostertag, who is a friend of mine, talks about Neopets. She was like, \"Man, back in the day, it was all about Neopets, that was the\\xa0thing.\" For me, it was Pogs, that was what I was into before D&D. What a glow up. ',\n"," '\\xa0[laughing] A glow up indeed.',\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) We got some great other questions here. We wanted to talk about this. This one\\'s from Eric J Zavadovski, thanks, Eric. \"How much involvement should a DM have when players build their PCs, e.g. to help background and party cohesion?\" Which we talked about a little bit, just a moment ago, but I also want to ask Kelly this question in the context of starting up a campaign with a bunch of people who are incredible performers and creators, but are totally new to the game. What are your go-tos for helping when you\\'re like, okay, these people know how to perform. They understand character, they understand media, how do you break down character creation for players like that?',\n"," \"\\xa0I will equate it to walking down a large grocery store's cereal aisle. Sometimes less is more. (Brennan laughs) \",\n"," \"\\xa0When you're walking down an aisle, do you want to be overwhelmed with every flavor in every single brand with all different sort of gluten free options? Or do you want to have a more narrow selection with people's chance to ruminate on the more narrow selections, and then going from there? Don't be afraid to start a little bit more narrow with newer players so they can feel comfortable having a choice within that world and within that space, but not throwing in so much that it becomes overwhelming. I would say that's a good place to start.\",\n"," ' I think that\\'s awesome, and I think too, one of the things that character creation is, it can feel like a slog at times, within that you want to race through to get the... okay, we only have three hours. Let\\'s get all these characters done. I think that there\\'s also something very joyful to taking the time and especially to explaining what things mean. Especially if you\\'ve been playing for a long time, you\\'re an old hand at the game. There\\'s a thing about like, great. So you\\'re going to feat, so what kind of feat do you want? Here\\'s some feats. And you\\'re like, \"What the fuck is a feat?\" Hey, you have to, you really have to, it was every time you have to be like, okay, your a character will be able to choose a really awesome ability from these lists of abilities that are, is a real way to customize it because it\\'s not attached to being a wizard necessarily. It\\'s unrelated to the magic and stuff that you do. It\\'s its own ability, its own right. Really spelling stuff out. And I think too, it\\'s one of those funny things that I think, for a lot of people, especially in your case, you\\'re working with people that know storytelling front to back. One of the things that I like to explain is like, okay, yes, this is a mechanical choice. It has to do with numbers and crunch, and it\\'s in the character sheet, yada yada. here\\'s the impact it will have on the story. I remember a long time ago, there was a person, a friend of mine made this character that was really un-optimized. It was like a paladin with almost no strength and they had all this other this stuff, and he\\'s like, \"No, I don\\'t want armor.\" They\\'re just wearing a tunic and all this stuff. And then, first fight, they get demolished, and the person is looking, they\\'re crestfallen, like what happened? And I was like, \"Well, your character, lovely though they are, got absolutely walloped from a series of disadvantageous choices.\" And the person went, \"But they\\'re the plucky hero.\" And I had to have this heartbreaking thing of being like, \"In a fairytale, pluck is very real. If we want your character to be plucky, we have to create that mechanically. You\\'re probably gonna have to take the lucky feat. You\\'re gonna have to do this other.\" And having that moment as a DM, where you go, I am always going to emphasize story over mechanics. However, the mechanics do affect the story. It\\'s okay to make an un-optimized character, but you need to reckon with the fact that this character, when combat comes around, is going to get creamed. If that\\'s fun for you and we all agreed that\\'s what should happen, that\\'s great. But if you want your character to succeed more than they fail for story reasons, like my character is competent, my character is a hero of the realm or whatever, we need to get the dice on our side, right? I feel very much like a good cop right now, of, like, \"Look, I want to help you, kid. But these dice over here-\"',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, you sound exactly like that. (laughs) I don't want to be the bad cop, though, I'm actually, that's just good cop good cop to me. Just be like, yeah, mate, good job.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, for sure. But I think that there's that moment when you're helping someone through character creation of explaining what certain choices are going to mean, right?\",\n"," \"\\xa0Well, so, especially if you're starting new, with new players, not being afraid to start them at level one, if they're not familiar with the game, because they're going to have a lot of choices (laughs) moving forward. And as they build and level up, instead of starting them at level three or level five, I think it's really not a bad thing to start at level one and go slower if they're newer and let them understand the mechanics of it. Now, if you're playing with a seasoned vet, so you can kind of go in a little bit older, or a little bit more rough around the edges and maybe bring them up more levels. But character creation is probably the most important thing for your players, not your story, not the other things, like character creation, 'cause that's what it's about.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, exactly, and it's those choices, I think a lot about... I've been running a home game for 11 years and--(Kelly claps)\",\n"," '\\xa0Thank you, and just had a whole-',\n"," \" I'm throwing the bears and the flowers back at you from my mental skating rink.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Thank you, yes. There's this incredible thing where occasionally it hits me, I'm like, we had a character creation session that lasted about two hours. And if you had gone to any of those people back in the day, 'cause we didn't... you don't start a game thinking this is gonna last for 11 years. But just the idea that somebody was like, I'm either gonna be this character or this other... the idea that there was a choice made in the moment on that one afternoon 11 years ago that those players stuck with for 11 years. So it's... I don't want to put too much pressure on it, but yeah, it's significant. You might be playing this character for a while. Make sure that you're making choices that will potentially, over a long period of time, that will bring joy to you. There's another question here. I think we have time for probably one or two more.\",\n"," \"\\xa0You're on my way, I'm going. (laughing drowns out speaker) I'm imagining I have a beautiful sword in my hands and I'm cutting the apples as they come in.\",\n"," ' That is true joy, chatting fruit with a sword is true-',\n"," \"\\xa0And I'm catching it in my mouth and eating it quickly. It's not, it's not cool at all 'cause I just cut it and I'm just eating food, chomping on it vigorously.\",\n"," ' Amazing, beautiful, surprising absolutely no one, but in my New York where we had this be played this big D&D group for a long one time, the last apartment I lived in before we moved to Los Angeles, we christened the apartment with a fruits chopping with a sword.',\n"," \" That's great.\",\n"," ' Yeah, beautiful, chop the cantaloupe-',\n"," '\\xa0Why would you... you have to be doing that in every apartment you move into, everybody. Canonize it.',\n"," \"\\xa0It's incredible.\",\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," '\\xa0The swords don\\'t need to be that sharp to really chop fruit. In your head, you\\'re thinking, \"No way, can I chop a fruit.\" You can chop a fruit.',\n"," '\\xa0You can do it.',\n"," '\\xa0You could do it. (laughs) This next question comes to us from Marshall Timmermans. Thanks, Marshall, \"I\\'m putting together my first campaign as a DM and I\\'m trying to convince my non-D&D playing friends to join in. Any advice on how to convince non players to give the game a try for the first time, and what can I do as a DM to make the experience as fun as possible?\" Yes, how does one go about selling the game? Because there is a... obviously if someone doesn\\'t want to play, that is their business and all the best to them and their choices in not wanting to play. However, I think there is definitely, like you\\'re saying, for a lot of people, I have always been very shocked in my life, and especially prior to this big moment where now there\\'s like actual play shows and people know what D&D is, and there\\'s write-ups about D&D all the time, but I would always be surprised at the demographics of who would say yes and no to an invitation right away. I remember going to SVA and, for screenwriting in New York, and there were a bunch of really cool kids. One kid had like a tattoo of a reel of film, safety pins, like dark tattoos, nose piercing, these sort of like goth hipster, rocker dudes. They\\'re in a class one time, and they overheard me talking about D&D and they came over and they were like, they were like smoking outside. They were like, \"You play D&D?\" And it was like, \"Yeah, like, are you... am I in trouble?\" I was also, I should say, I went... I was very young when I went to this college, so I was like 17 years old. And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And they were like, \"That\\'s fucking sick as hell. I always wanted to play, how do you play? Could we play?\" But other people definitely will cop a vibe around it of like, \"Ooh, D&D is not for me.\" There\\'s some part of it, and I think there\\'s a difference between, \"Hey, I am, as an adult human being, I\\'m telling you, I don\\'t want to play,\" versus someone being like, \"Oh, I could never do that because you have to be good at math.\" And you then have an opportunity to be like, actually that part of it really isn\\'t the most... have you ever had to give somebody the hard sell on it or no?',\n"," '\\xa0There has been one or two times where someone says, \"I don\\'t think I could ever play that.\" And I was trying to understand what they meant by that, \\'cause I was like, but you\\'re such a good actor. You\\'re such a good storyteller, this or that. Or you love board games. I was trying to understand why they had interest at least a little bit within little spaces of storytelling and world-building and then why they were so like, \"Oh, I could never with D&D.\" And I think it was a mixture of not knowing exactly what D&D was, as well as intimidation. I think that some people get a little intimidated by D&D because there is this sort of like, oh my gosh, the rules. Oh my gosh, there\\'s so much to learn. I feel out of my element, I\\'m not gonna be good at it. I\\'m not gonna be good at D&D. Nobody is good and nobody is bad. D&D is what you make it. And that\\'s where, if you can talk some people and help them understand, like, no, no, no, don\\'t be afraid of being good at D&D, just the idea is to have fun. So yes, I\\'ll guide you through some of the mechanics, but you can forget all of those \\'cause really what it\\'s going to happen is you\\'ll learn it as we play. And yes, there\\'ll be a lot of clarification about what we need in the first few game plays, but you\\'ll get the hang of it after long, after a short period of time. So kind of going to nod with that angle, I think would help newcomers, especially if that\\'s sort of what they\\'re saying.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And there's no point in... well, I think too, there's again, 'cause I also always want to be careful of like, if someone has told you they don't want to play, then they don't want to play.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Then they don't, yes.\",\n"," '\\xa0But I think that there really is this thing of, that one thing you can acknowledge when you are inviting someone to come play with you is the degree to which a lot of people make determinations based on their idea of what something is. And D&D is one of those things where if you haven\\'t played it, you probably don\\'t know what it really is. And that\\'s not... everything is like that. There are things that you can have not, if you... I\\'m trying to give an example, okay. If you see someone jumping off a big, tall rock into the water, you can look at that and be like, I think I have some idea of what that experience would be like. I\\'ve seen it from beginning to end and I understand sort of the principles of the physics involved. But a lot of people\\'s idea of Dungeons & Dragons comes from a reference on a sitcom, or something taken from somewhere else. And if you explain it to them as like, \"Hey, mostly this is going to be us sitting around a table on a comfy sofa, eating chips and hanging out, that\\'s 80% of what this is going to be.\" And then on top of that, we\\'re gonna be doing improv. We\\'re going to be kind of collaboratively doing an improv storytelling thing. And at moments of high stakes, we\\'re gonna roll these little dice that are going to make a decision about what happens. And you do that, and someone goes like, \"Oh, I thought this was competitive.\" Or, \"I thought this was that.\" So I would say, like you were saying, the best way you can convince someone to play is not really to convince them to play, but I think rather go and be like, \"If you are under a mistaken assumption, here\\'s what the game really is. Here\\'s really what\\'s expected of you.\" And then after that, if you\\'re still not into it, groovy, but if it\\'s cleared up some misconceptions about what is actually expected of people and you go, \"Oh, that actually does sound way more doable,\" then please come play \\'cause this game slaps. And it\\'s very fun. I love... I think we\\'ve got time for one last one.',\n"," \"\\xa0One last one, the penultimate question. No, I'm kidding, they're all great questions.(both laughing)\",\n"," '\\xa0I love it. So, ooh, this is a great one. So this one\\'s from Gus Rachels, thanks, Gus. \"Have you ever run slash played in a campaign where the party lost in the end? As a DM, do you have a contingency plan to make a TPK in a finale session not feel like losing the Super Bowl?\" This is an incredible question, and I think, first of all, I will just answer and say, I have never had a full TPK end a campaign. The closest I\\'ve ever come is have all the PCs truly lose a combat, where five out of six of them were captured and the last one managed to escape, right? But I think there\\'s a broader question here too. And I do want to answer Gus\\'s specific question of what I think you should do, even though I\\'ve never gone through that personally. But I think that this is one of the biggest questions that a DM has to handle, which is, how do you handle disappointment, failure, or a character just not getting what they wanted or what they thought they wanted?',\n"," '\\xa0That is so hard because I think that initially, depending on the environment, it can really change a mood. I will give an incredible example. There was a very, very, very, very big showdown with a very big situation with lower level characters, wading into territories that I constantly was trying to warn them not to go towards, for a very long time, in a fire temple. And this was our game right before Christmas break. So everyone was excited, but there was a lot in the air and people needed a good game to end the year to bring us into the new year. And we\\'re playing, and one by one by one they\\'re dying, (laughs) and you could see the energy of the room just deflate. And I said, \"What do you have in your packs?\" I\\'ll prop them, as a DM, I\\'ll be like, \"Look through your stuff, what do you have? What do you have, what do you have?\" And one of them realized they had a special whistle to help summon in an old friend that they didn\\'t think they were going to have to use, but they were in a desperate situation and they had to use it. It ended up saving their lives as well as a D100 roll that just so happened to hit the percentile needed to evoke one of their gods. And it was probably the most intense, intense session, not because of the session, but because of the time of year and the situation where everyone was just not, did not want to end the year on that note, that was sort of like the moment. And they\\'re all amazing players and people, but it\\'s just how the dice were rolling and how the choices were made were. And as that was happening, we were so relieved, they were so relieved afterwards that it didn\\'t end up the way it was going, \\'cause they said it looked like there was literally no option, we were all going to die and that was going to be the end. And I said, \"That\\'s never the end. It\\'s not, even if that had happened, you might\\'ve felt defeated, but that\\'s just a place to go for more story. It doesn\\'t mean that the story is over.\" I once ran \"The Death House\" with brand new players who are all executives in LA. I don\\'t think that was a good idea, don\\'t do that. But people could hire you, but I ran \"The Death House\" and (laughs) should have read the actual people, be careful running \"Death House,\" but I ran it. And of course the first time we all played, they all died. But because they all died in \"The Death House,\" I modified the story \\'cause they were new players to not make it feel defeating. And I said, \"You\\'re now all ghosts within \\'The Death House.\\' And you have to find your corporeal body is intact. But if you die within corporeal form, you vanquish.\" So it ended up building the second life, but higher stakes. And now they understood the mistakes they made. And they were so scared (laughs) of stepping on every floor board moving forward, but it ended up giving more story, and it made it an even richer story because of the liberties that I took as a DM to be like, wow, that feels a certain way. I don\\'t want us to feel this way, but I want us to learn from it and use it as a story. So you know, use it as a story.',\n"," \"\\xa0God, that's so good. So that ghost fix, did you come up with that at the table?\",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, I was just there and I was like, let's do it.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh, what a slick move. Oh my God, that is like... talk about quick thinking in terms of having a moment where you, and then that's, that's always what it is, is like that is like the storyteller instinct of like, okay, what next, like, no, no, no, it's not over.\",\n"," \"\\xa0It's not over, what next?\",\n"," ' What next-',\n"," \"\\xa0Just curious also for someone saying, okay, how do we end our campaign on the this-is-it moment, like a TPK, this is it. If they're all dying for a greater cause, that's awesome, that's great, do an epilogue, do an epilogue. Have the respect to give your players that epilogue, so they know though their character has died, the world continued on and their sacrifice was not in vain. That's important, you can still do it. You could still make it beautiful.\",\n"," '\\xa0So I think that\\'s so true. And that\\'s something beautiful too, because like in reality, the thing that most separates the world from stories... and we had this thing where we use stories to understand the world. We use stories to talk about ourselves and our place in the world and what we think about the world, what we think about ourselves and all these things. But the idea of... the biggest difference, of course, is in reality, there are no beginnings or endings. We are born into the middle and we will pass one day and it will still be the middle, right? We are participating in this large ongoing thing. And so when you\\'re storytelling, you are always picking your beginning and ending, which is not to say that your beginning and ending aren\\'t incredibly significant, but they really are arbitrary, like in \"Fantasia,\" in the world of imagination, those characters keep living after we say happily ever after, right? What a kind of incredibly convenient cop-out and like, and happily ever after, and you go, \"It\\'s done now, we\\'ve stopped the story now,\" right? But like you\\'re saying, if we can imagine the fictional world as a reality, in all likelihood, the pendulum keeps swinging, the ups and downs keep going. It\\'s like, sort of that beautiful Zen fable about, something bad happens, the Zen master says, \"Was it bad, we\\'ll see.\" Something good happens and the Zen master says, \"We\\'ll see,\" right? Really, so your endings are all about, again, where you choose to edit, where you choose to go, this is where the story comes to a conclusion. When you\\'re dealing with something like a TPK, I think something like Kelly said about those ghosts coming back is huge, right? In D&D cosmology, the afterlife is incredibly real and there are stakes in the beyond, right? And I think too, coming back, or if you have that TPK, can you provide significance, right? Is there something to that where you say, okay, yes, this is an end for these characters, but as we all know, the story is larger than that. I think that\\'s really what it comes down to, is the feeling of mournfulness and defeat. Sorrow and tragedy are cathartic feelings. Grief is cathartic, these things can be cathartic. What you want to avoid is the feeling of, this happened and it didn\\'t matter and there\\'s no catharsis behind it. So I think you can go to these places of deep sorrow, as long as you are prepared either to improvise something or you have something planned to go, yes, this is a moment of great defeat. However, again like that Zen master-',\n"," '\\xa0The story goes on.',\n"," '\\xa0The story goes on, wait and see, right?',\n"," '\\xa0Yep.',\n"," '\\xa0Gang, 90 minutes.

Today, we have such a wonderful guest. I'm so excited to share them with all of you. You know him as a singer, vocalist, gamer, and streamer and TRPG player online, he's created music for Critical Role, notably the theme for Critter Hog, which is a CR show about positivity and creativity in the TRPG space. He will also be moderating a panel during the upcoming D&D Celebration on what it means to be a bard. I'm slowly giving you clues as to who our guest is gonna be. Creator and host of the Black AF Roundtable series, where he led discussions with other black creators and artists in the TRPG space about race, racism, and being black in the tabletop community. That awesome Roundtable had a bunch of other members of the Dimension 20 family that you should go and absolutely check out. He regularly streams on twitch.tv, where you can see his show, In Unison, where he duets with someone else and discuss this various topics with them. He will also be appearing as a PC on a new stream/campaign called Creature Collectors, DM'd by Lili Sparx, and also featuring a member of Pirates of Leviathan, Aabria Iyengar, you know him, you love him, he needs no introduction, but we gave him one anyway. Please welcome the Critical Bard, Omega Jones. (cheers and claps)\",\n"," \" (cheers) “Yas, queen!” You gotta get the one in the back, the one that's in the back, just like “Yas, queen! We live for you.” No.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Know that that is absolutely happening in digital space. We just don't have the ability to port that in, in our audio. Omega, thanks so much for being with us today. How are you doin'?\",\n"," \" I am doing, that is the best I can do as we live in Corona country right now. So no, I'm doing well, I'm doing well. I am surviving, living, staying hydrated, because that's important. Yeah, I'm doin' good. I cannot, well, I mean, I can complain, but I'm not going to complain. I'm good, I'm good. I'm gonna make you spit out your water, I already know it's gonna happen.\",\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) Oh, no, a terrifying forecast for the episode with all this electronic stuff around me.(Omega laughs) ',\n"," '\\xa0Omega, it\\'s so awesome to have you. I\\'m such a huge fan of your work. You are an incredible vocalist, and artist, and someone who has brought a tremendous amount of talent to the tabletop roleplaying space. Talk to me a little bit about your history, both as like what got you into singing and performance in the first place? And then what got you into tabletop? And then, when was the moment that you realized, \"Hey, these two vectors are gonna come in together and create something really meaningful? What\\'s sort of your story with those different passions?',\n"," '\\xa0So, I mean, like, I\\'m just being real, like most Black people, they grew up in church, mostly because their mother and or the grandmother forced them to go, which is fine, that\\'s valid. But no, I grew up in church. I grew up with a loving family, and I was put into choir because most of the female folk on my family all sang, my sister, my mom, my aunt, my grandmother, my grandmother actually ran one of the choirs at my church, and all of these things. So I was quickly like, put into the church choir as a little boy soprano up there. And it was great, and I loved it, and that sparked my love for music. I\\'ve been singing, again, since I was a kid, in the stratosphere, like Mariah Carey. And with that, I learned about theater. My aunt also did some performance in theater, specifically \"The Wiz\", one of my favorite movies and musicals. And then my high school ended up doing \"West Side Story\" and \"West Side Story\" was one of my favorite musicals, like ever. I loved the movie, now that I look back at it, I\\'m like, \"Ooh, that\\'s racist,\" however, I did love that movie when I first saw it, and I auditioned, I got into the show, and then from there I became stuck in this artistic realm of theater, and music, and dance, and all that stuff. And that\\'s been my life since then. Skipping a couple of years later, I met a director, it was about, about four, four years ago, met a director when I was doing a 24-hour play festival, which is stressful, let me tell you that right now. And he was like, \"Omega, you wanna play some Dungeons & Dragons?\" And I\\'m like, \" Uh, no,\" but for some reason, I said, \"Yeah.\" We played, and I played my Tempest cleric, and there was something about that game that I just loved because I got to be myself as an actor, but with dice added, you know. I got to go in there and perform, and have these moments, and though it wasn\\'t about me, it was still something nice and familiar about taking on these roles, and these characters, and going through this journey, and doing all these things, yeah, adding a fireball every now and then, but there was something so just me about it that it stuck, and now I\\'ve been stuck ever since. That was about, again, four years ago, and now I\\'m here, this, this vocalist D&D guy who\\'s hot mess and eats Honey Buns. That\\'s me.(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0I mean, perfect, truly perfect. That's so wonderful to hear. I love the idea, what drew you to a Tempest cleric as your first character? 'Cause first of all, I love Tempest clerics, they're great, great class and subclass, but it's so funny to, was there any part of you, when you were first picking that, that like drew you to that specifically?\",\n"," '\\xa0So, yes and no. I know I wanted to play a cleric, there was something about the cleric that I liked. I didn\\'t know what that was, but I was like, this seems like it\\'d be me. You kind of support people from the back, and do all these things, but I also, when I was doing a lot of studying and looking into it, \\'cause that\\'s what I, just like any role I take on, I\\'m going to do the research and understand what this thing is. So I was like, looking into clerics and other stuff and I was like, but I don\\'t wanna always be the healer. That\\'s (blows a raspberry), that\\'s whatever. And then I saw Tempest and I was like, \"Oh, you can heal and do damage, okay.\" If anybody likes Overwatch, Tempest clerics are like Moira of the situation, you can heal or do a lot of damage. So I was like, \"Okay, I like them.\" So I picked that, and there was something about it I just loved. My cleric was a cleric of Talos, of storms and destruction, and he actually made it a point to be like, \"You need to pull your weight in this party or you will not get healed.\"(Brennan laughs) ',\n"," '\\xa0I will never forget, we got to this gauntlet type of place where we\\'re fighting a lot of different, like reoccurring enemies who just kept coming and coming. And one of them was a frost giant, and frost giants are not easy. And they knocked out one of our characters, it was the swashbuckler. And the swashbuckler all day had just been heckling my character, just doing these small, little snippy comments, and they got knocked out. And then my turn came around and the DM was like, \"Hey, so you have the frost giant, one of your party members are down. You can go heal them if you want, or do what you want,\" and I looked at them, and I looked at the frost giant, and I looked back at them, and was like, \"You can suffer for one more round,\" and I cast Shadow.(Brennan laughs)(Both laugh)',\n"," '\\xa0I\\'m like, \"No, you\\'re going to learn today, don\\'t piss off your cleric.\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0They have diamonds, you don't. But no, yeah, I loved that class. I actually haven't played a Tempest cleric since I played that character. It's weird.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Nope, I love that, again, that vibe is so fun, and when you tap into that character in that way, obviously a character class we need talk about other than cleric is the bard class. Now there's some obvious carryover as to why someone with your singing talent would be drawn to the game's magical musicians and singers. And you're running a panel for D&D Celebration, coming up this later this September. Talk to me a little bit about the bard class and what that means to you in the context of D&D, and what draws you to that class.\",\n"," \"\\xa0So, I mean, elephant in the room, I am a real life bard, but no, I, there was something about them. Well, firstly, you know, they are about support, and uplifting, and inspiring the group around them, and the bardic inspiration is literally embedded into their class features. So they are there to inspire and, and lift up, however, something about bards, and something I take into account when I'm performing as well, the point of a bard, to me, I am not perfect, and I'm not the end-all-be-all, the point of a bard, to me, is to tell the story. It is about continuing that history in such a way that you never forget. I used this example today, you probably remember one of the first concerts you went to. You probably don't remember the words for everything, but you probably remember the feeling you got, you remember what happened, you remember everything. Do you remember the first math question you answered in first grade?(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," \"\\xa0You don't.(both laugh)\",\n"," \"\\xa0But I mean, there's something about music and performance that allows history to never die, and I'm a big mythology nerd, I have always been a mythology nerd, and two gods that I legit wanna get tattoos of, or at least combine them in some way, shape, or form is Apollo, the god of music, and poetry, and all those things, and Anansi the spider from West African mythos. He is the God of stories, and there's something so powerful about both of them, and what they mean to me is simply remembering that no matter the situation, there's always a story that surrounds it, and that story is gonna go through generations and generations, that's why we know about the fall of Troy, or slavery, or all these other things, all these things that have died out, but we know them because a story is continuing to be told. And that's what a bard does, a bard is there, not just to support a party and inspire them in that moment, but inspire them until their last breath. That's why I like it.\",\n"," \"\\xa0That's really beautiful. And, it's something very fun, anytime you have a bard in a party, or in fact, I have a friend who is sort of a bard in real life, they are that perfect thing. I feel like one of the best pieces of advice I got was sort of like, every party, like you will never be in a situation where the bard isn't able to do something useful, because that's the whole definition of that character is that thing of passing on inspiration, having these a whole host of skills that they can use and call to their attention. And there's something very beautiful too about having a character archetype that honors storytelling and performance, while you are in a game that is fundamentally about the power of storytelling and performance, right? It sort of has that fractal, it's like echoes of what we're experiencing together at the table are here in this character, in the game with us.\",\n"," '\\xa0Exactly.',\n"," \" That's so beautiful. I love that.\",\n"," '\\xa0And yeah, I\\'m just excited to, I mean, with the panelists I have, first and foremost, they\\'re just amazing, \\'cause they\\'re all bards in their own right in the world. But I think we\\'re all gonna bring something beautiful to that panel because we all have experienced storytelling, and performing, or whatever your bardic style is. And we, again, aren\\'t the end-all-be-all, what it means to be a bard, but we have experienced it so in depth, it\\'s like ingrained in our spirits, that I think that we\\'re gonna be able to answer some questions and hopefully inspire, ha, inspire some future players who wanna also play bards. And we\\'re gonna also answer the eternal question, \"Why do bards always have to seduce a dragon?\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0I'm over it.(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," \"\\xa0I'm completely over it. (laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0I have a character in my back pocket that I almost, as I say, I feel like in every episode of Adventuring Academy, I very rarely get to play, I\\'m sort of a perma DM, but I have, that stereotype of like the hot bard, because there\\'s something like all of your six ability scores can be interpreted in all these different ways. And as someone who does not have the gift of a beautiful singing voice, I was like, \"Oh, I love the bard class,\" and was thinking about, what are other ways to play that archetype? And made this character who is sort of like the old, Irish fairy tale, peddler, traveler, storyteller character, that sort of trickster storyteller. And with the idea of a character who\\'s probably scruffy, and busted, and older, and not necessarily this hot seductive character, but has that other type of charisma where it\\'s like you hang on their every word, and all those different definitions of charisma that come off of that word, because it is such a, being the set skill, or the set attribute of a bard is their charisma. It is so funny to think, \"Yeah, this means more than just necessarily your seductive appeal.\" Otherwise, some really goofy things become true about the world where you\\'re like, \"Sorcerers get their magic from hotness.\"',\n"," '\\xa0Yup.(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, no, no, that's my thing. I'm like, so if it's based on the charisma that you think bards need to seduce dragons, why don't paladins seduce dragons? Why don't why don't warlocks seduce dragons? Why don't sorcerers seduce dragons? And all these other things that are charisma-based, they're not doing anything, so what is it about you, Bardy?\",\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) I will say a story about a paladin, of someone being like, [deep voice] \"My king has ordered me, I must seduce this dragon.\"',\n"," \"\\xa0That could be their oath, the Oath of the Ancients maybe? I'm here for that, I would be very here for that.\",\n"," '\\xa0Exactly, that sounds like a great story.',\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s funny you mention it because I get into, it\\'s not even an argument, but people think that to play a bard, you have to sing or dance. Not true, at all. Again, it\\'s about telling the story. Like two blards, blards, two bards I play, one is actually my main character \\'cause the Tempest cleric got killed, RIP. But I\\'m playing, I\\'m using Matt Mercer\\'s College of the Maestro bard. He doesn\\'t necessarily play music, he orchestrates the music. He is the one in the background just like, \"Uh-uh, no.” (laughs) \"Fix that chord real quick.\" He\\'s not really the most musical, but he can influence the way music flows around, and music isn\\'t just literally singing, it\\'s just that primordial power that can just inspire and boost. So, he\\'s been a lot of fun to play, and I also have a, oh lord, I, oh Lord, his name is Sigma, he is a war forts bard, and basically his story is that he was traveling with this drow bard who got killed, but he is the drow\\'s accompaniment, he\\'s his 808, he\\'s literally a beatboxing bard,(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0And sounds like GLaDOS. Just like, [robotic voice] \"Hello, I am Sigma.”(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0\"I will drop the bass, shatter,\" that\\'s him. (laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Oh god, the idea of an 808 bard is so good, just like, from that one character, all I wanna do is make a bright neon, 1980s fantasy.',\n"," '\\xa0Well it\\'s funny, because he has one of the instruments of the bard, but we flavored it to be a subwoofer that\\'s in his stomach. So literally he\\'s, (beatboxes) he gets, just constantly gets, always going. He\\'s so much fun, but he\\'s really not about music. He is music, so he can do it, but he\\'s not a singer, he\\'s just there, just like, \"Hello.\"(both laugh)',\n"," \" God, just the flavors of any spell that bard would cast, of just, Levitate is just the subwoofer orients down and it's just moving.\",\n"," ' Well, I can say one of my favorite, I just said it, but I\\'ll say it again, one of my favorite things I ever did with him was we were in a in a battle, and like I said, I beatbox with him, I\\'m not the best beatboxer, but beatbox with him, and literally he started breakin\\' it down, but he was like, (beatboxes) \"Drop the bass,\" and as the bass dropped, a big shatter happened.(Both laugh)',\n"," '\\xa0So the shatter is literally the bass dropping, it\\'s just like, \"Yes,\" and I killed a lot of people with that.(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0He's just so much fun. I love this character. He has an intelligence seven, but I love him.\",\n"," \"\\xa0(laughs) That's so perfect, oh, I love that so much. And you know what's funny is, so, I don't know what order these Adventuring Academies come out, but we happened to record a couple days ago an Adventuring Academy with your co-PC on your new stream coming out that is DM'd by Lili Sparx, which is Creature Collectors, which that'll be on Twitch? Or where's that gonna be living?\",\n"," '\\xa0That\\'s gonna be on my channel, we actually, we are gonna be, wow, blanking. Sundays, Sundays at three Pacific? Two Pacific? One of those Pacifics. But yeah, we\\'re on my channel, and yeah, Lili Sparx is the DM, Aabria is amazing, and oh, I don\\'t know who her character is, I just know that she is a gorgeous woman with bright white hair, and I am so ready. It\\'s gonna be a good, it\\'s gonna be a good campaign, especially because in our DM\\'s own words, \"It is inspired by Pokemon, Digimon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Ghostbusters.',\n"," '\\xa0I love this so much. But so, both talking about your character Sigma, and talking about this upcoming Creature Collector, which is inspired by these elements of pop culture and storytelling that I feel like everyone growing up around me was like obsessed with \"Digimon\" and \"Pokemon\", and still is. But that idea of using these pop culture artifacts that we know and love so much, and applying them to this game, that in its written materials doesn\\'t reference those pop culture things. Aabria was talking about this herself, being like, \"There\\'s nothing as fun as bringing your own references, your own culture, your own stories, your own archetypes and tropes, and things like that into the game with you,\" and you talking about Sigma and then launching this thing, this new stream that will be \"Pokemon\" and \"Digimon\" inspired, I just love, that\\'s my favorite element of the game is, putting those twists on the source material to be like, we\\'re gonna tell this new genre with that. When did you first, \\'cause I feel like a lot of people when they start, \\'cause we have a lot of people watch this show that maybe haven\\'t played their first game yet, they\\'re gearing up the courage, or they\\'re getting the people together to run their first game, how long did it take you before you were like, \"Actually, I am gonna put a twist on this to bring this new genre into it?\"',\n"," \"\\xa0(laughs) So, it actually happened pretty quickly, but that's where my mind goes. So backstory, but not really backstory. I was trash, first of all--(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0But I used to love to roleplay on Tumblr. I had so many accounts, I had so many accounts, and it was just so much fun to take these characters that we knew, like Agent J from \"Men in Black\", or a Sam Witwicky from some, \"Transformers\", like all these random characters, and just bring new life to them. So, I started applying that to D&D because I really did, back then, I would wake up and do whatever, and be like, \"I\\'m gonna make this character today,\" and I did. And that\\'s kinda what started happening with D&D, where I\\'d just get inspired by these random moments, and what happened really quickly after I had this Tempest cleric, and some other stuff, and one of those players in that 25-person campaign--(Brennan laughs) ',\n"," ' We don\\'t all play at once, but during our finale days, we do. But one of them was like, \"I wanna DM something if you all wanna join, make a character.\" For some reason, the first thing that came to mind was, I\\'m going to play Waldo, like \"Where\\'s Waldo\" and D&D, and I named him Wadlow, and he was an arcane trickster, and he always had to steal things to make him invisible. And his girlfriend was Carmen Sindigo, and all these things like, yeah, yeah, I went full in. But I was like, I like taking pop culture and all these things, and it\\'s showing that this game isn\\'t just about like Fae room, or the forgotten realms, or all those things that\\'s there, you can take that and flavor it, and make it what you want it to be, \\'cause at the end of the day, as we\\'ve already said, as I flip it and reverse it, this game is about telling a story. It\\'s not telling their story, it\\'s telling your story. So make the story whatever you want it to be.',\n"," \"\\xa0The best possible advice you could walk away from this with, I have two, I want to dive more into that topic because I think that's so important for people that want to play this game to hear that, but I need to digress and say, there is such a bizarre echo, bizarre in terms of how synchronous it is, I used to freeform, text-based roleplay on AOL Instant Messenger every day.(Omega cheers)\",\n"," \"\\xa0Every day, you know your boy was on AIM every day doin', I had a character in this setting run by some good friends of mine, it was called Zane Academy, and the whole thing was, it was like a Hogwarts for Zane, which was a type of magic based in cartoonish, absurdist, surreality. So one of my students that was going there was named Elroy San Diego, he was the child of Carmen San Diego and Waldo, and he was so good at hiding that it was like a mutant sort of X-Men power he couldn't turn off. People had a hard time remembering him because their neurons couldn't find the memories of him that they created.\",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, that makes me so happy.',\n"," '\\xa0He was a very sad, shy, little boy, who was just constantly trying to be, teachers would be like, \"You\\'ve been absent, we have to fail you.\" And he\\'s like, \"No, I promise I\\'ve been in every single class.\" So it\\'s very, he was so good at hiding, but his life was quite sad, but it was a, so it was a very fun, so first of all, weirdly synchronous that we both have, in text-based roleplay, had these characters Wadlow and then Elroy San Diego. But I think that that is something that\\'s really important too, and I wanna tie this back into other work that you\\'ve been doing in the TRPG space, because I picked up these books a long time ago, I was like 10-years-old when I picked up these books. And similarly, it wasn\\'t that long before I got the itch to go, \"I want to tell other kinds of stories in this space,\" because I think that that is the secret gift of any tabletop game, be it be it Dungeons & Dragons, be it, you know, the vast amount of indie games that are out there, is always, there\\'s not gonna be a rep from the game company at your table. The only people you\\'re really beholden to are you and your friends, and the golden rule is gonna be, are we all having a good time? Are we all communicating? Are we all respecting each other? Are we building a story that\\'s getting us all equally hype and excited? And I wanted to talk a little bit too about some of the other work that you\\'ve been doing in the TRPG space, specifically to make it a more welcoming and inclusive space to people that the game has not always been as welcoming and inclusive to as it should be. For anyone that has not watched the Black AF Roundtable, please do yourself a favor and go check it out. It is an incredible resource for anybody that is interested in making their table more inclusive and welcoming. How did that project get started? And what were your first steps that sort of inspired you to start that, and to bring those people together?',\n"," '\\xa0So to be very blunt, someone got killed. Someone got killed, yet again, I wanna also start this years back, 2014 back. I lived in Ferguson.',\n"," '\\xa0Wow.',\n"," '\\xa0I was there when he got killed. I was not in the streets, but I was there, in my hometown when he got killed. That\\'s really sad because I was coming home from rehearsal that day, and as I was coming home, my friends was just like, \"We\\'re gonna take you to our house.\" And I was like, \"Why?\" And it was like, \"You know why.\" Just no. So went to their house instead, in a town over, and I knew everything that happened, and everything was going down, and then the indictment trial happened, of the officer. And I was in my house in Ferguson, literally up the street to the left is the police station, and I remember all my friends are like, \"It\\'s tense,\" and you know, just super immense feelings. And I had went out as well with my brothers, just looking around, seeing how the, how the energy was, and I was getting all these texts, and all these things, people were like, \"Is there gonna be a riot? Is this gonna happen? Are people are gonna be mad?\" And I\\'m like, \"Yup.\" Because we all knew what was gonna happen. And he didn\\'t get indicted, and literally, it was like a bomb went off. We just saw the chaos ensue, because we were so angry. So I\\'ve lived personally through it. Thank God I am not a statistic, I haven\\'t been one of those people, hopefully I never am, but know that I witnessed it enough and I\\'d lived it myself. Then we come to now with George Floyd, and you know, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and all these other people who are just so many names, you can\\'t even count them anymore. George Floyd, specifically, his death is what triggered or was a catalyst for a lot of the outrage, and riot, and protesting, and everything happening. And I was sitting here like, \"What can I do? Because I\\'m tired.” (laughs) \"I am a black man in this world who is tired of living in a world that doesn\\'t want me to exist. How do I even process? How do I go on?\" And I had this thought, and I posted on Twitter, and I was like, \"Who wants to chat? \\'Cause I know a lot of people feel like talking, who wants to chat?\" And I got some feedback, and some thoughts, and people was like, \"I\\'m in,\" and all these things, and I reached out to Tanya DePass, AKA Cypheroftyr, and I was like, \"Hey, do you wanna be a part of this thing?\" She was the first person I asked. And she was like, \"Yeah,\" and then I also reached out to Krystina Arielle, Gabe Hicks, Honey and Dice, Michael Sinclair II, and Brandon Dixon. I feel like I\\'m missing somebody, nope that\\'s everybody, plus Tanya and me. And I reached out to them and was like, \"All right, we\\'re gonna do this, we\\'re gonna do this, this is the Black AF Roundtable, because one, we\\'re Black AF, and two, people need to understand our feelings.\" And in the same vein, in that same parallel universe, we were dealing with a lot of the orc discourse that was happening within Dungeons & Dragons, orc and drow, and all these things, also the Vistani in Curse of Strahd, and all these things, and we were like, \"So much is happening, We\\'re tired, blah, blah, blah. Let\\'s get it all out.\" So, with that, and the deaths, we said, \"Let\\'s make this Roundtable.\" So I made this Roundtable, I hosted it on my channel. I was like, \"We\\'re gonna do this, I\\'m not the best at doing this, but let\\'s do it.\" And it was something that I didn\\'t know that everyone would need. I did not expect it to go as far as it did. I\\'ll never forget looking at my Facebook, maybe like an hour or two after it was done, and realizing that Will Wheaton had posted about it. And I was like, \"What?\" But that\\'s how much people didn\\'t realize they needed something like this, because it wasn\\'t being talked about. And I wanted to specifically make sure it was, \"While we\\'re Black and living in this space, we\\'re gonna always talk about it as a whole.\" I wanted to make sure it was centered in on being Black in the tabletop community, because there\\'s a lot of overt racism that we know of, but there\\'s a lot of covert racism that has happens as well, and we needed to talk about both. When you talk about why people needed to understand that orcs and drow as inherently evil, especially being the monstrous, or the dark version, is bad. That\\'s not okay. We needed to talk about all these things, and it was nice to do so. And then once that one happened, and we saw how many people liked it, we thought \"Let\\'s do another one.\" And we did another one a week after, and then we just did one last week, that was the third, third 0.5 rendition. And I say 0.5 because I was not expecting D&D to reach out and be like, \"Hey, for D&D Live, do you wanna do a version of the Roundtable?\" \"Sure.\" So we did it for D&D Live as well. So it\\'s been a conversation and something that\\'s been a big part of my life that I didn\\'t know I needed, and I\\'m glad it happened, and I\\'m glad people are getting the free education that we are giving people. (laughs)(both laugh)',\n"," \" Truly from the bottom of my heart, thank you for doing that, and to your fellow members of the Roundtable as well. It is something that is needed, it is dramatically needed, both for, I think for every single person in the hobby, because, you know, there's a conversation I had recently with someone that was talking about like, you look at the inspiration, as you've said, for that first thing, which was again, a horrifying murder by the police, the murder of George Floyd and that prompting, hopefully every single sphere, hobby, no corner of the earth should not take that, and in fact all of these horrific deaths, as part of us reckoning with what we have control over. And I think that's something that maybe people that are watching this show right now can hear for themselves is that there is something to do within your hobby. There is some part of the little corner of the earth that you occupy that requires this care and attention as well. And you know, that discourse around orcs and drow, it does have an impact, and it does matter, and it's so encouraging to see the power of that Roundtable, from my perspective, really be an inflection point where the conversation around that changed and a critical mass of people now get why that is, not only matters, but is true. The viewpoint shared by you is obviously something that cannot stand and has to change. So thank you very much for creating, again, it's like you're talking free education, it's an incredible generosity. Any time people like do the hard work of putting something like that together and producing something that is this living resource on the internet for people to educate themselves, it is an act of generosity that anyone now can go and educate themselves using that. So thank you very much for that.\",\n"," \" I mean, it's one of those where I was like, obviously it's not about the money, but also pay me.(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0But I mean, period, because guess what? Google is your friend, you cannot beat him. Hello, I\\'m introducing you today. But it wasn\\'t just about that, it\\'s just the fact that someone needed to do it, And it\\'s not one of those, “If no one\\'s gonna do it, I\\'m gonna do it.\" But it\\'s just, I have the platform now. Thankfully I have the platform and I have the masses who are willing to listen, so why not do something with it? And at that time I was like, \"That\\'s what happened, it felt like that was the right thing to do.\" So I\\'m glad, I\\'m glad that people listened, and I\\'m glad, and I hope, and I say that cautiously, I hope that people heed what we said, and listen, and don\\'t listen to throw it away. Don\\'t listen to just blah once it\\'s all done, \\'cause unfortunately, we talked about that at our last round table. We watched two months of the best performance of a lifetime because I tell people, I am a equity actor. I\\'ve performed professionally, and there are better performers than me on Twitter, and life. I talk about, we found this graph, and I forgot what the site was, but you literally can see on the side over here, you literally can see May, June, July. Instantly, and it\\'s like, wow, but it\\'s one of those, \"While that\\'s a lot of negativity, and while I know that people didn\\'t really want to care, they did it because a fad, and it was a trend to do.\" There are some who are putting in the work and are continuing, and listening, and taking that in, and trying to better the spaces around them, whether that\\'s within tabletop, or their families, and all that stuff. And while I\\'m not gonna give you a chocolate chip cookie for your effort, I do see it, and I thank you for it.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, I think that's all completely right on. And, you know, it's it's one of those things where I am very for exactly what you've said, it makes me very glad that these are continuing, that you guys are doing more of them, because I think that it is a call to arms that should never stop being called. And so deeply, deeply grateful, and glad, that these like Roundtables continue, because I think that you're exactly right. Looking at the things we've covered that we can see you on, and we can consume your talent, your content, your thoughts, your wisdom, your experience, I wanna talk quickly as well about In Unison. This is a show where you invite people on to duet with them. Talk to me a little bit about In Unison, how that project started, and also where people can check that out. I assume they check it out at your Twitch?\",\n"," '\\xa0Um-hmm, so In Unison, to me, it, everything happens for a reason. There are two things I believe in, and that\\'s time, that\\'s fate. One, things happen when they\\'re supposed to happen, and two they\\'re going to happen whether you want them to happen or not. So, after the Roundtables, I was chatting with my friends and I was like, \"You know, I really like hosting, I really like moderating, I do it very well.\" And especially living in the plane of pandemics and COVID city, where we can\\'t perform or do anything like that, I\\'m like, \"This has been a good outlet for me creatively, and just being able to be on and all those things.\" And while it\\'s not about me, I tell them, it did feel good to actually host and moderate So I was like, \"I\\'m gonna do something else,\" and didn\\'t know what that was. And then I was just looking around, and seeing the fatigue, and seeing how much people were working, and it feels like nothing\\'s really happening, and I wanted to do something where I spoke to some more visible people in the community, not to target anyone, but I wanted to focus on some more visible people in the community who put in the work, whatever that work is. And I wanted to have a show where they can just relax and be people, not their product, just be the person that they are. So that\\'s where In Unison came from, In Unison, we duet, AKA just me and another person, we duet about life, liberty, and the pursuit of being a hot mess. That\\'s one of my taglines. (Brennan laughs) ',\n"," ' It\\'s just, we sit down for two hours, we take a break in the middle, I say, \"If you wanna,\" I don\\'t know how much I can say, if you wanna have a drink, have a drink. If you want to eat, eat, do whatever you want.\" But it\\'s just us talking, yes, I have topics, but it\\'s us just vibing, feeling each other\\'s energy, and just enjoying a couple of hours, not worrying about work, not worrying about stress, not worrying about life. It\\'s you come in and muse, do whatever you want, and it\\'s been very cathartic. I\\'ve had a good chunk of guests on there now, and I\\'m always asking for more, if you want to be on, let me know. But yeah, it\\'s been nice. Like I started with Brian Foster from Critical Role, and that was a bad choice because he\\'s a mess. I love him, he\\'s a mess. I can say that, he\\'s one of my closest friends. He\\'s a mess. (laughs) But Brian Foster and I just had Todd Kenrick from D&D Beyond, and Aabria actually is appearing next week. So just, it\\'s been so good, not just for me, I am benefiting from it, just from being able to chat with people. But it\\'s been nice seeing these folk who I know are just stressed, and just tired just come on and be like, \"Oh, thank you. What\\'s up?\" That\\'s been nice, so that\\'s what that show at, the shows is just about chill vibes and good times.',\n"," \"\\xa0That sounds completely lovely. (laughs) Chill vibes, and good times. That's, well, that's excellent. So this is, there's so much incredible Omega Jones content out there on the internet. If you're watching this, you should absolutely go check it out. I think it is high time for us to jump into some of these user-submitted questions from our Dropout Discord Server. Thank you everyone for dropping these questions to us.\",\n"," '\\xa0Woot woot.',\n"," \"\\xa0Whoo, we're going to talk about some questions people have for, hey, how I do this tabletop roleplaying thing. And our first question comes to us from Emma. Thank you, Emma.\",\n"," '\\xa0Emma!',\n"," \"\\xa0“What advice would you have for someone who is playing in a group that the group is not that big into RP, but they themselves love RP. If I do the voice that I know is right for the character I'm playing, I know that I'll be the only one doing a parentheses bad voice. How do you balance different play styles between a group of friends so that everyone is enjoying playing?” Thanks for the question, Emma.\",\n"," ' Honestly, so it\\'s two parts of that. This is gonna sound mean and weird, but no one else matters. What I mean by that is, if you\\'re enjoying the role that you\\'re playing, if you\\'re enjoying the character you want to play, just because someone else in your group isn\\'t doing that voice doesn\\'t mean you have to stop. It\\'s something that brings you joy. It\\'s not like you\\'re using it to upstage people and have the spotlight on you, it\\'s just you playing a character. I naturally have voices when I play too, because it feels right, and it feels like what I want to do. I also play with a lot of engineers who don\\'t really care about roleplay. They care about the numbers of the game, and that\\'s valid too. You\\'re gonna find that not every table is super unanimous in how they play. Obviously you can talk, I mean, session zeros, if you don\\'t know what a session zero is, a session zero is the session zero, before one. It\\'s a pregame, it\\'s to talk about what you want out of a game, what you expect out of a game. Nowadays, we talk about using safety tools, which are ways to make sure your game is safe, and happy, and good for everyone playing. You lay out what the type of character you might end up playing, you don\\'t have to tell secrets or anything like that, but you let them know, this is what I\\'m interested in, this is what I wanna do, and all these things, and you all talk about what expectations are from each player. And then, once you set that going forward, it\\'s a breeze. Again, if they don\\'t roleplay or act like you do, one, you\\'re not doing anything bad. Take those parentheses away and throw \\'em to the moon, they don\\'t matter. You\\'re not bad. You\\'re just having fun, and it\\'s okay to have fun. So yeah, I mean, talk, talk with your party, talk with your fellow players, talk with the DM. If you\\'re the DM, you definitely could talk with the parties and just be like, \"Hey, I see folks are more interested in combat, and then I see you\\'re more interested in social, or exploration,\" talk about those things. You can come together to make a beautiful game.',\n"," '\\xa0Beautiful, I love that. I think that that\\'s right on the money. And again, one of the things about D&D is that you are going to have, in any given party, a degree of everyone bringing their own unique flavor to the game, right? So that\\'s gonna be happening no matter what. I think that if you have insecurity or nerves around being the person at the table doing the voice, I would just say that I have been a part of games and also seen games, I used to be a camp counselor and people would be playing games in the corner, you could be the one person doing a voice and have that be a joy at the table. There is nothing to indicate that just, in the same way that, I think the best thing is to appreciate what everyone is bringing to the metaphorical potluck, right? Let\\'s say you have that number crunchy person at your table who\\'s super into the numbers, that could be a wonderful person to have at the table when they, you know, they pull a rules lawyer for justice move that gets you all out of a bad, mechanical situation that you\\'re in. Or they remind you like, \"Hey, you actually have advantage on this roll,\" and you\\'re like, (gasps) ',\n"," ' Exactly, you hit the nat 20--',\n"," '\\xa0You have the one that, you know you forgot this certain part of history, but they\\'re like, \"Actually I wrote it in my notes because you won\\'t.\"(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0There's nothing wrong with that.\",\n"," '\\xa0Nothin\\' wrong with that. As long as everyone\\'s vibing, and everyone\\'s communicating, it\\'s all good. And so, being that one person with the character voice at the table can be a source of joy. I remember being really young and playing the game for the first time where I was one of the few people at the table who was really comfortable emoting. And I was playing this character that was a guardian angel, but that had been sworn to the service of what ended up being a really bad person. So it was a kind of, that period of \"Aladdin\" where the genie is serving Jafar, and he\\'s super, and so everything that my character did, I was like, \"Please forgive me, I have to do this, but I really would rather not!\" And so it was like, oh, and it, I think that in an ideal circumstance, you will find that if you\\'re doing something that brings you joy, if you\\'re playing with other people who genuinely want everyone to be having a good time, even if they\\'re not following suit, it can still bring joy to the whole table for you to engage in that.',\n"," '\\xa0Agreed, 100%.',\n"," ' Hell yeah, thanks for the question, Emma. This next one that comes to us from Piper F, thanks, Piper.',\n"," '\\xa0Piper!',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah! \"I know music can make the setting and tone clear, but where do you believe the best D&D music comes from? I would love to incorporate into my campaigns, but I feel like I can\\'t find the right music.\" This is a great question. There are obviously a lot of services that provide this that are specifically, you can find DM DJ or Syrinscape, or stuff like that. Honestly, I\\'ll throw out, I do a lot of my DM DJ just on YouTube. There\\'s tons of free, whether you\\'re looking for ambient stuff, or a specific track. I remember there was one specific scene in my long-running home game where we literally, I had a cutscene narrated to the Nicholas Brothers\\' tap routine with Cab Calloway singing.',\n"," '\\xa0Yes! You just became my best friend, sorry about it.(Brennan laugh)',\n"," \" It's what life is now.\",\n"," \" For those that haven't checked it out on YouTube, it's up on YouTube, it is the best filmed dance, I think it's not, I will go to bat and say, it's the best filmed dance routine in film history, go watch it.\",\n"," '\\xa0It is iconic.',\n"," '\\xa0Iconic is the exact word. It is unbelievable. And we had this, there was this thing we were narrating where I was like, \"Oh, our sorcerer from this, this is a world, because this is an old, old campaign, it\\'s sort of a, sorcerers work a lot more like warlocks, where they get their powers from other beings. And there was this moment where this sorcerer luck child kid had been wheeling and dealing between the personified sort of arcana of destiny and the personified arcana of luck, who were in competition for years, and years, and years. And at the very end, the, the kid managed to get double, get out of the contract where he sold his soul to these two. And it ended up in this whole dance routine song and number where luck and destiny were doing the moves of the Nicholas Brothers\\' from Storm. It was very, very indulgent, but huge capstone on this moment. So you can have those moment where you bring, I want you guys to just hear this music, or watch this thing, and know that this exactly is happening in this moment, which was very, very fun and rewarding. But to that point, whether you\\'re doing specific musical stings, whether you\\'re doing scoring, like just sort of tension building music underneath, or whether you are doing ambient noise, like a forest at night, so, you know, with bird song, wind howling, all that\\'s available on YouTube, and you can mess around and experiment with that.',\n"," '\\xa0And honestly, two things I want to say really quickly. One, it just made me happy. You talked about the personification of destiny and the personification of luck. When I was Tumblr roleplaying, I actually played the personification of coincidence and they were in a, not a rivalry, but in a somewhat of a rivalry with the personification of fate, \\'cause they\\'re like, “You have to do this.\" Nah, it\\'s just gonna happen when it\\'s supposed to happen, it\\'s fine, we\\'re gonna chill. Like, it just happened, like \"No, you had nothing, it just happened, chill.\" But I think it\\'s funny you said that, I was like, \"Ooh, that just took me back.\" Any who, but also, it\\'s also important to denote, \\'cause truthfully, are you trying to stream this game or are you just tryin\\' to play at home, or with friends? If it\\'s on stream, be careful you\\'re not doing anything that will get you copyright struck, \\'cause you will, real quick. However, though, if you\\'re just playing with friends at home, legit, video game scores are your best friend. (laughs) Skyrim has some of the best ambient music out there. It is just gorgeous, it\\'s there. I use it a lot, that, Halo, all these other games that you just don\\'t realize have some really good music in the background, just look and I guarantee you, there are playlists on YouTube. I personally use Spotify, \\'cause I love Spotify. You can look, and honestly you can look up on YouTube, D&D tavern playlist. I guarantee you, you will find something that someone\\'s made for the exact thing that you need. So look it up, he\\'s right. YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, whatever, they have the things for you. It\\'s there, have fun.',\n"," ' Hell yes. Incredible resources await. This next one comes to us from JK. Thanks, JK.',\n"," '\\xa0JK! JK.',\n"," \"\\xa0(laughs) “How do you balance slash effectively collaborate with your players on world-building as a DM?” Great question, thanks, JK. How do you effectively collaborate on world-building with your game master, your storyteller, your dungeon master, whomever? This is a question that a lot of PCs have, and it's a very funny thing because I've been thinking about this a lot recently in terms of, there's this kind of static idea in D&D, and in a lot of other tabletops that have a GM of, I am responsible for my PC. The other PCs, or the other players, are responsible for their PCs, and then the dungeon master is responsible for the world, the NPCs, external phenomenon, right? But we all know that that that line gets blurry and in a lot of places can, and should, be fudged, it should be, that barrier should be broken down, right? Because first of all, a lot of players will end up creating NPCs by creating their family.\",\n"," '\\xa0Right, exactly.',\n"," \" Right? So those are gonna be NPCs. And one thing, actually, that I remember talking about with a PC a long time ago, was a DM should never make a decision for a PC. And it's like, yes, that's absolutely true, however, if you think about it, DMS already do have some authority over the inner lives of PCs when you're narrating a dream. That is very much the mind. How much control does the DM have over the subconscious mind of a character? When, you are controlling it, when you're describing a PC's perception or insight role, oftentime you are in collaboration over what's going on in that PC's mind. What you notice or don't notice, right? Omega, in your home games and in your streams, what do you do you feel like the best guidelines or rules are for that boundary and navigating it of PCs collaborating in world-building?\",\n"," \"\\xa0So firstly, You, like you said, you already inherently add to the story when you add PCs to your PC's life. When you add NPCs, sorry, to your PC's life, like family and things of that nature. But I think a good way of going about it as well is, you kind of have the ability to influence your home, unless the campaign itself is about the town that you're in, then your might have a specific ideas. But even then you can influence it. Like I'll take Creature Collectors, for example, I won't give spoilers really, but I don't think it's gonna matter, this might air way after. We were asked specifically what our PC is, obviously, what happens around our PC, who's close to our PC, things of that nature, and you have the ability to shape what goes around, not just with your character, but the mile bubble, or 30 foot bubble around your character. And that is building on the story. Like for instance, my character Agrios, in Creature Collector, he is a wild soul barbarian Leonin, he's a lion with a rainbow mane.(laughs)\",\n"," ' That is so cool, oh!',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, the big thing, the big plot line, which I'm not gonna spoil, but the thing is, he was left at the doorstep of a half elf family, wrapped in this beautiful cloth, and a stick that was next to him. And that stick is now the part that's attached to the ax that he uses now, the cloth is his loincloth, and he has naturally rainbowness in his hair. And whenever he rages, it moves, it shifts, he doesn't know what it is. But, with all that being said, he, I, I designed his trainer who taught him how to cut wood and other things, I designed the town around him, what he'd normally go through, what he'd do throughout his normal day. And the DM takes that, and then builds the story from that as well. You don't have to always put it all on the DM. You have the ability to influence what you want and what you believe happened around your character, and then they will then take that and collaborate, and make something really pretty about it, really pretty from it. \",\n"," '\\xa0Those are always, to me, my favorite things to do are to world-build off of something that was itself, a gift. Like a player created something, gave it to the story, and then you moved from that. Back in my days when I was an improv coach and teacher, I used to say all the time, yes, I did improv at UCB, and performed in New York for many years, and--',\n"," '\\xa0Nice!',\n"," '\\xa0(laughs) So there you go. But we, one of the things I always said is, the improv is not about making stuff up fast, you know, making stuff up is something that is a skill you learn really early on. Being creative is one thing, the magic of improv doesn\\'t live in the moment where a sober adult on a stage, you know, that pays taxes and is responsible, goes, \"Oh my god, green aliens are descending on us.\" The magic of improv is in someone saying that, and the second responsible adult going, \"My god, you\\'re right.\" That\\'s--',\n"," '\\xa0The “yes, and,” yeah.',\n"," ' The affirmation of that thing. So the best part, for me, is someone sends me a little bit of backstory, they say, \"Here\\'s my trainer, here\\'s another person,\" and you take that, and five sessions in, 10 sessions in, suddenly, that comes to life in front of the person. And you\\'re like, \"See? Look, that thing that you made came to life.\" That\\'s the best feeling in the world to take as a DM. So, I think, exactly like you\\'re saying, I love PCs having authority to engage in that world-building and create that background. I think the only time that ever gets problematic or troublesome is if people are doing stuff that is going to intersect with some element of your plot in a weird way. But I think the easy way around that is to just create these domains where it\\'s like, \"Hey, your character, you, as the player, feel free to improvise, you know, cool, you\\'re this Pokemon collector. If you\\'d like, feel free to improvise anything about the knowledge of that craft, and that will become true,\" right? You kind of make these domain-specific things that for the most part work out, I think, really, really well. And again, it\\'s super gratifying to be able to “yes, and” those as the GM position, when those come to life in the world.',\n"," '\\xa0For sure.',\n"," '\\xa0I love that. We got some more questions here.',\n"," ' I like questions.',\n"," '\\xa0I like questions too.',\n"," '\\xa0I wanna make a question bard now, whenever they talk, whenever they do something, it\\'s like, \"Why?\" Ooh, that\\'d be interesting flavoring all their spells in the form of a question. Almost like Jeopardy.',\n"," '\\xa0“Riddle me this, Batman.\"(both laugh)',\n"," '\\xa0Yes.',\n"," '\\xa0The Riddler as a bard is very cool. Doing a high fantasy Batman with all, statting out all the different--',\n"," \"\\xa0So, fun fact, I'm actually, so we've been playing, a couple of us have been playing an Avengers-inspired campaign, and we're starting a Gotham-inspired, two shot coming up in a couple of weeks, and I'm actually playing Zatanna.\",\n"," ' Oh, god, Zatanna is one of my favorite characters of all time.',\n"," \"\\xa0She's gonna be an illusionist wizard, and I literally changed all of my spells and turned them backwards.(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," \"\\xa0I'm not ready. I am not ready at all.\",\n"," '\\xa0Oh my god--',\n"," '\\xa0I do know \"Rojam egami\" is Major Image, I know that.(Both laugh)',\n"," \"\\xa0I had that one ready, I don't have Comprehend Languages ready though.\",\n"," ' That\\'s gonna be hard, that\\'s a lot of consonants in that one, yeah, that\\'s gonna be a hard one to get through. Oh my God, that\\'s so cool. This next one comes to us from Harrison, thanks Harrison. \"Hey Brennan, one of my least favorite aspects of DMing is running shopping segments, as it\\'s a hassle to come up with a handful of shopkeeper NPCs and their wares on the fly. And it always grinds the pace of the adventure to a halt. However, I know it\\'s an important way to reward players and let them spend all the gold they\\'ve earned. Do you have any alternatives to the standard shopping experience that would satisfy both me and my players?\" Thanks for the question, Harrison. This is an interesting one, \\'cause I feel like not every campaign dives into, necessarily has an economy like this. Would you say like, the majority of games that you play in have that kind of really statted out number economy to them? Mine don\\'t, for the most part.',\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s like, \"Hey, you got 400 gold.\" Am I ever going to use it? I don\\'t know. But I have it, thanks. But no, it really doesn\\'t get, I mean, my home campaign he\\'s done something really cool, just because we\\'re based in the actual sea, in this place called the Planisphere that he\\'s kind of made his own. So we have ways to spend money, and I get things, but like past that in other games, not really. It doesn\\'t really come up, and I wish it did actually, because it\\'s there.',\n"," ' Right, exactly. Well, it\\'s interesting in 5E because, in 3.5 D&D, magic items had costs. So part of the reason you were getting these goofy piles of gold, that if you really start to think about, like, if you kill a dragon and get its golden hoard, you have just, yes, you\\'re rich, but you\\'ve also inherited the biggest project in the world now of, how do we move all this gold? You can\\'t just go to the local town and be like, \"Hey, I got this money I need to put in,\" it\\'s like, does this world have banking? Where do we put this mountain of gold? Some magistrate from the King is gonna be like, \"You\\'re going to destroy our economy,\" you know.(Omega laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0\"Inflation!\" But, I think that one of the, listen, I have a bell that I keep ringing all the time, which is that the key to world-building isn\\'t logistics, it\\'s tone, right? It\\'s tone, it\\'s genre, it\\'s mood. And I think if you are playing a game that really feels like a fairytale, it\\'s gonna be a weird vibe when you go try to buy a magic sword. Look for any culture in the world that has mythic heroes, and have it be like, \"Where did you get the sword of the King?\" And it\\'s like, \"I bought it in town.\" (both laugh)',\n"," \"\\xa0Nope, that's not how the fairytale goes. Nope. No matter what storytelling culture it comes from, it's sort of like, if you're in that mythic space, economy is not, commerce is not gonna feel like the right vibe.\",\n"," ' Yes, agree.',\n"," '\\xa0So, I think that you need to go to a couple places. One of the weird things is that D&D is an old enough game that it kind of has its own mythos around it. So, going and buying potions that cost a certain amount of money, and like, before the adventure we go and buy potions. That is a vibe that does, even though it\\'s not mythological, it\\'s established through D&D, it\\'s established through Final Fantasy. You go get your phoenix down, you go get your. So I would say to you, if you wanna run fun shopping encounters in your thing, make sure that you\\'re in a world that feels like Final Fantasy, or it\\'s not gonna vibe, right? And for me, I tend to, or make it that comedic, either make it that you\\'re in Final Fantasy world and you have this intense economy, make it a world that\\'s really low magic, that\\'s all about survival. If you have pirates, if you wanna do a gritty pirate campaign, make survival hard, make it like every day, have people mark off the money it takes to feed themselves so that you\\'re playing in that gritty world. But also, I think, one of the things that I still do, to this day is, because I don\\'t want the feeling of like, \"Where did you get Excalibur?\" \"I bought it, I bought it at the sword store.\" You can track how much treasure people should be getting, and convert that into magic items and stuff rather than being like, \"Hey, you have X amount of silver pieces and Y amount of gem-based art objects rolled on table 35C.\"',\n"," ' Period.(Brennan laughs) ',\n"," '\\xa0It\\'s like, \"Why? Why do you have an art piece of Mona Lisa in the fae realm? Why do you have it? I don\\'t understand. I don\\'t.\" Now if it was Beholder Lisa, I\\'ll get it, but still.',\n"," \"\\xa0The Beholder Lisa. But that's my thing is, Beholder Lisa is rad. That should be something we know is gonna be in this. I would rather, if we're going to have Beholder Lisa, let's have a heist around it.\",\n"," '\\xa0Yes, yes, yes, yes.',\n"," '\\xa0Beholder head, beautiful gown, hair coming through the eye stalks,(Omega laughs) ',\n"," \"\\xa0Smile, and it's like, you have no idea--\",\n"," \"\\xa0Just smiling, knowing she's about to disintegration ray you.\",\n"," \"\\xa0(laughs) Like run that heist, that's cool as hell, and then there's a story behind it. Again, it's it's kind of funny, 'cause I feel like I don't want to answer the question by invalidating the question. There are ways to do shopping that are fun and cool. However, my go to is usually if you want to hit this mythological fantasy tone that feels like mythology, feels like storytelling, you know, objects of legend should be acquired in legendary fashion.\",\n"," '\\xa0I agree.',\n"," '\\xa0Fully.',\n"," '\\xa0But I also want to say though, that you are the GM, DM, whichever title you choose, it\\'s your life, live it. You do have the ability to be like, \"Okay, you want this potion of healing? Well guess what? It\\'s not here.\" You have the ability to wherever you\\'re at, whether you\\'re at a big major town, or you just happen to stop through this area that has a merchant just selling things off to the side, you have to ability, one, to set the tone of that shopping scene, or whoever\\'s selling the things to you. If you\\'re in a major city, yeah, they might have some extra things, but keep in mind that that won\\'t be the case everywhere. And even with that being said, you can say in your mind, going into this game, going into this session, knowing that they\\'re probably potentially going to go to a shopping person, you can say, \"Yeah, they probably have one potion. They have this one thing. They have this one thing,\" \\'cause they might\\'ve acquired that. And if you wanna bring magic items into it, something I like to do personally, when I have DM, or I\\'ve played in games, is have a magic item that isn\\'t necessarily catered to anyone in the group, yet. Have it be something that they want to learn about. Be like, \"They have this thing,\" \\'cause you don\\'t wanna have a random magic greataxe for the barbarian there, that\\'s not fun. However, having a random wand that does something that the barbarian\\'s interested in, for some reason, I don\\'t know why the barbarian would be, but having, or a pebble that\\'s actually an opal that is inserted into a hilt of a blade that they have to find, that is more story-driven, and that\\'s going to add more for the characters in the long run. Don\\'t cater to the characters just because they wanna shop. Guess what? You shouldn\\'ta got hit by the fireball. (laughs) Dodge it next time. I mean, that\\'s being extra, but this is the truth. Not every shop is going to cater to the characters, and you have the ability to say that. You have the ability to say, \"They don\\'t have everything that you want. How are you going to figure it out?\" \\'Cause that\\'s what D&D is, figuring things out.',\n"," \" Yes! It's problem solving. It's collaboration. There's so many things I want to respond to in what you just said, I love that. Number one, I think that's such great advice to give people cool magic stuff, but give it to them in a way that's gonna create dynamic, interesting stories. Like one of the best magic items I ever got, Molly Ostertag gave a character of mine, I was a multi-class monk cleric and--\",\n"," '\\xa0I played a mult-cleric too.',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh, it's great, it's so good! And you know, what would be the things that would make that character, that if Brennan, the crunchy math player was sitting down, to be like, how do I optimize? How do I? You know, something that increases my damage output, something that allows me to, doubles my movement, yada, yada, something that makes me more mobile, 'cause I'm already focusing on that. I got a Ring of Water Breathing, it was the coolest thing in the world because it didn't optimize my character at all, it gave him a power that he was, he was a Tempest cleric from an island, Tempest cleric from an island setting that specifically had a connection to the ocean. And when he got the Ring of Water Breathing, every scene where I could just swim down into the water and be down there interacting with the sea life, it brought that character to life. So I think your characters will, look, the urge to keep your PC alive is real. I'm not going to fault anyone for wanting to crunch numbers to make their character optimized, 'cause who wants to lose their PC? When you could've gotten two more hit points from that right feat you could have chosen, right?\",\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," ' But, as a DM, you can give people that pebble, that wand, that thing that is going to unlock another side, and another story from their character, and I guarantee it\\'ll be better than giving them that sword that exactly optimizes the ability that the character already has totally focused themselves on. The other thing I wanted to say too, to what you said was, you were talking about not having it be specifically catered to them. This store is doing what it\\'s doing, and I think this is a golden rule for DMing in general, which is, to a certain degree, figure out what it is this scene, or this story beat is trying to accomplish. What is the role of this? I might, in your circumstance for Harrison who\\'s asking the question, clock my players, and go, \"Okay, these guys have all expressed an interest in shopping, they wanna go get materials.\" Clock the vibe. Again, it\\'s all communication with the people, the real human beings that are at the table with you. Are they excited to have their characters go and shop? Or is this your players trying to take necessary precautions for the next dungeon? Because if you\\'re clocking them and it seems like the vibe is this hyper practical, no one\\'s using their character voice no one\\'s going like, \"Let\\'s see the shopping district in town is like,\" they\\'re like, \"We need to get supplies for the dungeon.\" In that case, listen, if it\\'s a certain time of night and I\\'m tired, I might be like, “Look, I\\'m gonna go make coffee, open the player\\'s handbook, that\\'s how much stuff costs. I\\'ll be back in 10 minutes,\" and be like. \\'Cause if they don\\'t want to run a scene, you forcing them to do that is not necessarily gonna be the right vibe, right? You know? I think sometimes too that, especially if, also, if you\\'re a DM that has harsh consequences where the last dungeon they were in, you were like, \"Oh, you guys don\\'t have a 10 foot pole? All these traps go off.\" Don\\'t be surprised when they want a shopping trip at the next, \\'cause you\\'ve trained them to--',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You train them to expect something. So yeah, but you\\'re 100% correct. Is it more character driven or is it player driven? And neither one is better than the other, and one isn\\'t more important. It\\'s okay, both are okay, but understand what angle they\\'re wanting to shop for, and base it off that. My DM does it a lot. He knows that we\\'d like to stock up at times, \\'cause specifically, in my home game, we don\\'t necessarily go into the world, we go into these instances and the memories, and we have to figure something out about that memory. But he specifically said this last time, \"When you go in, we\\'re gonna be in there for a while, so get everything you need before you leave, because guess what\\'s not happening in game? Shopping, unless it\\'s like in that memory and it makes sense.\" So yeah, that moment where I was like, \"Yeah, we need to make sure we have this, and we have that, and we\\'re prepared.\" So know are they doing it because they just wanna be prepared as players because they might be too reckless and they always rush into battle and they need healing? Or is the character actually interested in finding something? And if it\\'s character-based, those are the perfect moments to be like, \"Yeah, you have a potion, but there\\'s also this box. Do you wanna open it?\" You have those moments, it drives the story. So yeah, it all depends on what they\\'re looking for. Honestly.',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. I totally agree. Love that question. Speaking of instances, that sounds so cool by the way, and are those runs sort of like flashbacks, or are they, how?',\n"," \"\\xa0So the story is, oh, the story is so good, but basically we're in the act three of the campaign. This is the last part of this campaign. And we were led by this leader-type person. So the Planisphere is basically this place where they track wild magic instances, and all of these things, just trying to make sure that everything is as it should be. And it hasn't been that way. Long story short, that leader person got killed in the act two finale, and he was hiding something. He was doing some stuff that basically helped him become this god-type being who was past the gods, and all this stuff, he's tryin' to rewrite the world, and rewrite the story, and there's just a lot. We're going into his memory, this specific memory, we're gonna find out why he was doing a lot of stuff that he did. So yeah, these instances are this, these little pocket bubbles that we get sent into. It's like blue skin dude, blue skin dudes, can you jump into, but it's been interesting to play it like that, because we have done times where we went to Chult, or we went to Fae, and all these things. But we've had a lot of these moments where, we're literally going into the memory and we're becoming that person in the memory. So yeah, it's interesting. It's been a lot of fun. This has been stressful, but it's been a lot of fun.\",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, I love, that sounds so cool. I love that kind of trippy, ooh, especially because D&D\\'s such an interesting storytelling medium because it can, because it\\'s structured like the players are living their day-to-day real life. And there can be that interesting balance between verisimilitude, and realism, and being like, \"Hey, we\\'re just, we\\'re going shopping, we\\'re making pragmatic decisions, we\\'re being people in a dangerous situation, making the choice we really, really make.\" And then on the other hand being like, but we want arcs, we want narrative, we want story. And so, hearing a campaign has something so geared up to be like, yes, this is tangible, and real, and in game, and also, it\\'s providing this catharsis, and insight, and storytelling, ooh. (smooches)',\n"," \" It's nice, it is very nice.\",\n"," \" Hell yeah. So here's a fun, this actually, this question brings us right to this next one from James. Thanks, James.\",\n"," '\\xa0Hey, James, got a peach?(Brennan laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0Woo, I just watched that movie recently.(Omega laughs)',\n"," ' That movie is so crazy, though, ants drive on the bottom of the ocean from England to New York, and that\\'s normal, and the bugs are, any case, I\\'ll get into it another time. Watch that movie, it\\'s, there\\'s some weird stuff going on. James asks, \"What\\'s the best way of putting flashbacks into sessions for the PCs? And how do you prep for them?\" Great question.',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, that\\'s good. Oh, we got warned in the campaign that I\\'m starting that we\\'re gonna have flashbacks. So they\\'re just, it\\'s on my mind right now. Honestly, so again, goes back to something we already said, know your character\\'s backstory. Know your players\\' characters\\' backstory. And if you don\\'t know it, talk to them, and understand it, and you can take those moments, those specific moments that you know are blips in their history that made them who they are, you can take those and hone in for a second, and you can do it through dreams, you can do it through, honestly, one of the best parts, one of the best ways someone\\'s ever done a flashback for me was that we knew that we were going into a really big battle and we were doing all this stuff beforehand, and you know, getting prepped and whatever, and we got through the door that led to where this big bad was. As the door opened, flash of white. We went into a flashback. We went into what happened, how we prepped for this moment, each of us. It was like, \"Oh no, oh no!\" But those moments that add to the overall drama, and excitement, and just that drive, and that power, within the moment of going into that door, everything that happened before that, we got to just have that moment. And it was just like, \"Oh,\" and as the last person finished their flashback it flashed back to the door opening, and he was like, \"We\\'ll finish off next week.\" How dare you? We got to, like those moments, you can take a flashback and make it powerful by inserting it in the most random moment that you wouldn\\'t expect a flashback to be. Like you wake up in the morning, and you\\'re all in a tavern, or whatever, and you go down to eat some cereal, or you go down and eat bread or whatever, and as your character looks over at someone across from them, a flashback can happen then, like being with your family and havin\\' a good time because right now it sucks, but back then, it was okay. You can insert those flashbacks in the best spots, and the best spots are the spots that they don\\'t expect it. It\\'s not a dream, or you\\'re stuck in a spell, it\\'s just out of the blue, it feels right, it feels like they\\'re not expecting it, so that makes it even more exciting for them, in my personal opinion. I don\\'t know, how do you feel? Cause I think, it\\'s nice when it\\'s off guard. It\\'s like, \"Oh, oh.\"(Omega laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0Honestly I feel like my response is any way you can get 'em. I never met a flash back I didn't like. Well, here's the thing, I think you're a 100% percent right, that they are, there's so much to say, this is such a good question. What I'll say is this, I think using flashbacks is an incredible tool. I've used it, and I think every single season of Dimension 20, and certainly every home game I've ever done, and they all have a different purpose, right? You know, we have a character who's a dream sorcerer in the Unsleeping City. He's got a ton of weird dream trippy imagery that you know, is, very classically mythological, in terms of finding visions in dreams. But it's also, I think, a very helpful tool for a dungeon master, because look, I'll be honest, you're limited as a dungeon master, in terms of your adventures and plot hooks because, you know, I am responsible for this universe and all of it having causality, dominoes hitting each other, but I'm just some guy, I don't know. I'm not always the best predictor of what people are gonna notice, or what people are going to catch, so a lot of times you'll use dreams, and flashbacks, and those metaphors to highlight moments of focus, of I'm gonna, just like in fairy tales, a dream is gonna give you a moment of clarity about what you should focus your attention on, right?\",\n"," '\\xa0Yes.',\n"," \" I think flashback, I think also we look at flashbacks as what does a flashback accomplish? And I think the issue for that is, very quickly TRPGs accumulate the present, you start in the tavern, you start as the adventure begins, and we have this present moment, but we don't have the past. And what we know intimately and deeply about the real world is that the past is present with us all the time. It is around us, everywhere. Everything around us is explained through our history and through our past. And it can be really challenging to get into character, to understand the stakes of an adventure, to feel the weight of a given moment, without feeling the lived reality of the character's past. So I think flashbacks are vital and necessary to take the character that isn't humanized yet and fully humanize them by seeing where they come from and what their story is. To see a moment where we see how a villain became the way they are through a looking glass, a crystal ball, some scrying thing, a pool of water, because again, you know, limited perspective is part of the reality of everyone in our real world. But when we're trying to tell a story at the table, it can be so gratifying to be like, here's this new perspective. I love flashbacks when they occur, you know, we've had flashbacks in A Crown of Candy, that season we just did, where the characters watched one of their first PC permadeath in the campaign. And the PCs were all fleeing from their vastly more powerful enemies. And as they were covered in blood, and breathing heavily, and knew they were in danger, we just flashed back to these little moments, as you were saying, when things were better, right? Of better days and--\",\n"," '\\xa0That is so good.',\n"," '\\xa0It was like, it\\'s so important. You see, and we can feel the characters round out, and the detail increases, and you see these moments, because one little moment can give you this other source of light and add an entire new dimension to a character and make it so much more playable and fun for that PC. And I think the way you prep for them too is, know what it is you\\'re trying to say. It\\'s okay to be like, \"We are gonna see a moment of heartbreak that is going to illuminate this present moment, where we see why this character is so guarded. We are going, you know, there are, know that it\\'s just, not to bring it to singing, but it\\'s those certain notes that you play will harmonize, and they will bring something that is greater than the sum of its parts.',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh my gosh, oh, them running away and just having flash, oh, that's, that's sad.(Brennan laughs) \",\n"," ' That\\'s sad, I will be honest, I mean, we\\'re all human, I have not been able to watch all of, you know, A Crown of Candy yet, but I\\'ve been wanting to just go back and just, \"Okay, I love this group, \"I want to learn more. \"Candy?\"(both laugh) ',\n"," '\\xa0So I\\'ve been like, \"Yes, yes, I need this. \"I need this a lot.\"',\n"," '\\xa0Well, listen, I feel like we have to play at some point now so that I can give you the full flashback treatment.(Omega laughs)',\n"," '\\xa0I love that we\\'re both so into this, and I think it\\'s great too, what I love about the instances from the campaign you were describing is I think flashbacks can be totally great, whether they\\'re diegetic or not. In that case with the running, the flashback was like a total TV or movie flashback, where the characters, it was like, we were changing where the camera was. The audience was seeing a flashback, but the characters weren\\'t necessarily seeing that flashback. It was for narrative purposes. But, I think it\\'s awesome to also, like you\\'re saying, the moment at the bar, the person flashes back, they are lost in their memories for a moment. I will say, be aware if you create flashbacks that are really diegetic, and they\\'re tangible in the world, like in this case, it\\'s a floating bubble, it\\'s a living memory, you can jump into it. I did a flashback one time that was in the Halls of Legend, and these characters could go and see their friends. And it actually ended up being one of the coolest moments, this same luck and destiny source where I was talking about, went into the party\\'s wizard\\'s memories, but it was sort of like, it was more than memory, it was legend itself, it was the past. And the party wizard was this intense, dour, older guy, had watched his father be killed on the deck of an airship. And his father\\'s arch rival threw this kid over the banister of the airship, and the kid hit the ground and survived. And the wizard had taken toughness feats and all these things like that, but it still was like, \"Man, how your character survive?\" It was just part of his backstory that we never sort of addressed. It was like, that\\'s intense, but realistically that\\'s pretty wild that he would survive. In any case, no one knew that part of the wizard\\'s backstory, the luck child sorcerer character went into the legend of this moment, saw it, saw the young, you know, 12-year-old boy that would become the wizard thrown over the edge, and as the sorcerer was a guest in this memory, he threw a luck spell of protection out and hit it, retroactively justifying how that had happened back in the moment. It was one of--',\n"," \" Oh. That's so good though. That's so good, but like time is intangible, anything like that, you don't know what's influencing it, and just the fact that he jumped in and actually was basically the reason he survived.\",\n"," '\\xa0Right? Yeah.',\n"," \" That's so good. Oh, that's awesome. That just gave me feelings.\",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh, I'm so glad, yeah, that was one of my favorite, so yes, that's the kind of thing, I think, whether the flashbacks are tangible, magical elements of the world, or you're just using them, like how a TV or a movie would've use them, where they're a narrative tool, it's all groovy.\",\n"," '\\xa0Agreed.',\n"," '\\xa0This is so fun. I think we have time for probably one more question here.',\n"," '\\xa0One more tetion.(Brennan laughs)',\n"," \"\\xa0This one's--\",\n"," \"\\xa0I tried to say “question,” and that didn't come out. It's like, (vocalizes). Any who. (laughs)\",\n"," ' The feeling was there. Exactly. This one comes from Julie B, thanks Julie B.',\n"," '\\xa0Julie B!',\n"," '\\xa0\"My party has a fair split of shy and outgoing players. How can I, as a player, encourage shyer party members to jump in more often? Or should I respect that they don\\'t want to, or aren\\'t comfortable speaking up as much?\" Thanks, Julie B. Yeah.',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. I mean, we kind of touched at this already, it\\'s the fact that, it\\'s two things, again, it\\'s not just about the DM, you as players, can also facilitate this idea of bringing people in. But before I get into that part again, that\\'s session zero extrapolation, what people are comfortable with. And I know this is already happening, so this is a little different, but for anyone who is starting, and you know that you\\'re gonna be playing with some folks who are a little more shy, and then you\\'re playing with the prima donna, which isn\\'t a bad thing, it\\'s like, understand comfort levels of every player, even as a player, and then you know how to navigate the game once it happens. But for you, already being here, one, you can talk to them, out of character, and be like, \"Hey, I noticed that you\\'re, you know, a little taken aback, or these things, you kind of are a little more quiet. Would you be okay if I brought you into the story more blah, blah, blah? Do you want to talk about potential stuff with our characters? So even being shy, your character who might not be shy has something to lean on, which makes it easier for you to get into it. And with that established, you know, yeah, again, take that metaphorical bean bag, and as you\\'re talking, and talking around a campfire, you\\'re saying, \"Hey, Jody, how are you?\" You throw it to them. It\\'s not about making them have a spotlight, but it\\'s just asking them a question, just subtly bringing them into this fold so it\\'s not, it\\'s interesting how it happens, you bring them into the fold and they\\'re helping you with with your story, but slowly but surely, as you talk to the talk to them, it\\'s becoming their story with you backing them up, and you\\'re now allowing them to blossom into this game. So yeah, talk to \\'em. Talk to \\'em, talk to \\'em, talk to \\'em, communication is key.',\n"," ' Yes, I think that\\'s totally on the money, and I think that, yeah, as an all things, there is a degree of communication, you\\'re playing with other adults. And I also love the caveat there of, I\\'m a very extroverted person, I can be gregarious, and so there\\'s a part of me that when I see someone not doing that, I go, \"That person\\'s having a bad time.\" You don\\'t know that, people have different experiences of things, so I think it\\'s, there\\'s a piece of wisdom here of, don\\'t assume that because someone is not talking as much as you think would represent engagement in the game, that might not mean that they\\'re not engaged. They might be really engaged and having a great time. So I think communication is key, \\'cause you don\\'t wanna assume necessarily, and I think that, but that\\'s also a vibe thing. I think if you\\'re good friends with someone, you can tell what, you can tell from your friend, like, \"Oh, I\\'m getting a feeling from them that they\\'re not talking and this is a problem, versus they\\'re not talking and it might be be, or might not be, right? So communication, and I think too, that there\\'s a give and a take here, right? Everyone has a part to play. If you have really gregarious players at the table, you know, make sure that gently and kindly be like, \"Hey, let\\'s make sure that everyone has an opportunity to interact with NPCs, that people are getting spotlight scenes, right?\" That can be a conversation you have to make sure that no one\\'s getting steamrolled. And as a DM too, I think you can have that conversation of like, \"Hey, what are you as a player who\\'s maybe not as gregarious, or not as extroverted, what are you looking to get from the game?\" Because you can spotlight that. You can be like, \"Okay, I know that when I throw these characters into a rowdy tavern, player two, three, four are gonna just run off to the wind and have a great time. Player one is not about that, but they\\'re playing a wizard, so I\\'m just going to make sure that there\\'s always some little piece of arcana, some new book, a new spell, so there\\'s always something in a game session for them, latch onto, because I think that really the key to this question is, shyness is not necessarily, shyness is not in and of itself indicative of a problem. The person may just be more comfortable observing, more than verbally contributing. So I think, you know, figure that out with them, and if you do get a response back like, \"Yeah, I actually would love to contribute more.\" One thing that was really fun was I remember there was a shyer player I talked to one time who talked about the overemphasis on roleplaying, and people kind of talking combat down of like, \"That\\'s crunchy, that\\'s number stuff, we don\\'t care about that,\" and the shyer player was like, I really like combat because turns are really helpful for me.\"',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, yeah, yeah.',\n"," ' You know what I mean? Taking a turn, I don\\'t know how to interject, I don\\'t wanna take away from someone else\\'s moment, so how do I, in a roleplay scene, I don\\'t intuit the give and take, I don\\'t have whatever that inner math is of what talking too much or not enough looks like. Think about taking turns with roleplaying. As a DM you can introduce that. Like you\\'re saying, tossing that beanbag, that\\'s effectively like giving a turn to someone. I think that\\'s a hugely helpful thing to help with a shyer player. And I think too, of notice, I think you can also help in character creation, if you have a friend that you know is more shy, I think, talk with them about that and go, \"A, are you into an experience that would be challenging? To like play the bard? Are you looking for that to be like, yeah, I wanna play the gregarious character.\" In the same way that people want to play a character unlike them in some ways to get that experience, or it\\'s also totally valid, listen, I, again, I think in life I\\'m pretty gregarious, I have played quiet characters and had the time of my life being in a session where I only said five things. You know what I mean? I remember I played a giant one time who was this big, imposing giant character. And it was really fun to be a, you know, a man of few words, right? That can be a fun vibe.',\n"," \" That was actually Sigma for me. You would think Sigma talked a lot, he didn't. He talked when he needed to talk, or he talked when he thought it was the right time to talk, and he acted when he thought it was the right time to act. I'll never forget one of my favorite moments with him, again, he has a intelligence of seven,(Brennan laughs)\",\n"," '\\xa0And they were like, we had to protect this little girl, we were in Verdan, we had protect this little girl and get her to this place. And they were like, \"We need to make sure that she isn\\'t seen.\" And one of the paladins, actually it was Tanya\\'s character, looked at me and was like, \"Do you have anything that you can make someone invisible?\" And he\\'s like, [robotic voice] \"Oh, you need to be invisible now?\" And he\\'s like, \"Yeah.” And he\\'s like, \"Oh, okay,\" and he cast Invisibility on the girl, and she was like, \"I mean, we all need invisibility though. Can you do that?\" He goes, [robotic voice] \"Oh, you need it as well? Okay.\" And he ended it on her and put it on the paladin. He was like, [robotic voice] \"We\\'re done, do you need anything else?\" And she\\'s like, \"I hate you.\"(both laugh) ',\n"," '\\xa0It was just a small moment, he\\'s not a talker, but he\\'s like, \"Oh, this is when I\\'m needed, okay. This is what I do,\" (laughs) but totally bad for the moment. But those moments that you think someone isn\\'t talking, or isn\\'t paying attention, or isn\\'t into it, they actually might be, they\\'re just waiting for their turn. They\\'re waiting for the time to do so. So it\\'s okay. But again, it goes back to communication. It\\'s okay for you to say \"Yes, this is a game, so let me talk to you player-to-player. Are you actually, are you here? Is there anything I can do? I\\'m just checking in as a friend. This isn\\'t like an intervention or anything like that, Just, hey, I noticed, blank. How are you feeling?\" And if they\\'re like, \"I\\'m good.\" You\\'re like, \"Oh, okay, great.\" But it\\'s just about the communication.',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, I think that's absolutely 100% on the money. Oh, I cannot believe how fast an hour-and-a-half has flown by.\",\n"," '\\xa0It really has.',\n"," ' Oh my goodness.

And welcome to another, but very special episode of Adventuring Party. I am your storyteller Gabe Hicks from Shriek Week, and I have the crew that helped me make this amazing story even better. There are so many incredibly talented people here, but I have talked too much. So let's introduce who some of them are. And right off the bat, let's go talk to Tyler who has been responsible for so much of the amazing edits that we saw. \",\n"," '\\xa0Hey, yeah I\\'m Tyler. I was the editor on \"Shriek Week.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Yes you were. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Thank you, Tyler. You made the Zooms look beautiful. And then my favorite was definitely the zoom on Ally, when Seven said that Megan was gonna be eaten, one of my favorite ones. (Tyler laughing) ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, like everyone\\'s still talking in it like came over to the Ally, and they were like that one. Yeah, it was super fun to play with the zooms. It was fun because the season itself, like being put onto a desktop and making you feel like you\\'re in that desktop environment and like it kinda lended itself to be more like a reality show in a sense. And so that\\'s why I was like, \"Oh, okay these zooms could be fun, and we could like find some humor with that as well. ',\n"," '\\xa0And lets go to Rick, who made so much of the beautiful pieces that we got to see. ',\n"," '\\xa0Howdy, I\\'m Rick Perry, I\\'m the Production Designer and Creative Producer on \"Dimension 20.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0And then over to Kevin, who pretty much answered any questions that I had on set. And thank God for that. (Kevin laughing) ',\n"," \"\\xa0Hello, I'm Kevin Stiller, I was the cinematographer. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh yeah. And let's bring it over to the man himself, David Kerns. \",\n"," '\\xa0David Kerns, I\\'m an Executive Producer for \"Dimension 20\" overall and was so excited to work closely with Gabe for the first time. It was amazing. ',\n"," '\\xa0And then Katie. Katie, who also basically when I was concerned or terrified, Katie was way more calm than I was. Thank God. (Katie laughing) ',\n"," '\\xa0Hi, I\\'m Katie. I\\'m the calm art director for a \"Shriek Week.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Look how calm. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, it was incredible. I was like, \"Katie, I don\\'t know how this is possible.\" She\\'s like, \"No, it\\'s fine. I\\'ll just have it done tomorrow.\" How? Yeah, okay. Paula, who actually... I don\\'t... We got to talk a little bit, but not as much. ',\n"," '\\xa0I know, it\\'s funny how that works out. Nice to meet you in person Gabe. (Paula laughing) I\\'m a graphic designer on \"Dimension 20\" and I do a lot of the on-screen graphics. ',\n"," '\\xa0You did a great job. ',\n"," '\\xa0Thanks, this was a really fun season. It was really unique to do. ',\n"," '\\xa0And then our artists who made all of these really weird concepts come to life. Thank you Bee. ',\n"," \"\\xa0I'm Bee, I drew all the hot monsters. (Tyler and Bee laughing) \",\n"," '\\xa0And last but not least, Orion who basically helped me keep a lot of my sanity. When I said \"Orion, they did nothing that we were planning. They did nothing that we were planning.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Not a single thing. Hi, I\\'m Orion D. Black, creative director here at \"Dimension 20\" and a co-writer of \"Shriek Week.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, yeah. And so right off the bat, I wanna ask this question. Because the asker\\'s name is Franken Berry. (Orion laughing) And he wanted to ask anybody. “So what an incredible season. I know that making \"Dimension 20” is no small task, and involves the work of dozens of people who never appear on screen. So for everyone, what was something about this production that made you particularly proud?” That\\'s for anyone. ',\n"," '\\xa0Can I be proud of other people real quick?',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Because, okay, so Katie and Rick made the coolest props. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh my God. ',\n"," '\\xa0That just set the tone so well. Like we asked for some pretty fun stuff. I remember when we were asking for the banners that you see in the backgrounds between the characters. That when we got those, like it felt official. Like, it felt like we had it, like we had the atmosphere, we had everything, but that was just the start because we ended up getting those awesome booklets and all of those flyers and the jackets. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yo when I was like, can we do jackets? And the team was like, yeah sure. Like really? Like just making the desk. The number of top... When the desk first showed up, the number of comments just across social media that were so excited about the desk, was like, is that tiny aspirin? ',\n"," '\\xa0Ibuprofen. ',\n"," '\\xa0Tiny ibuprofen gives me so much joy. Every time I would see it, I\\'m like, \"Oh, it\\'s tiny.\" ',\n"," \"\\xa0Remember seeing the placement we were like, no, no, turn it a little more. We don't wanna be on screen like that's ibuprofen, but we wanna know. Like, we have finessed that for a while. \",\n"," '\\xa0Outstanding. ',\n"," '\\xa0I would also like to shout other people\\'s praises. I mean, Katie and Rick for sure, but basically this whole team. Every season of \"Dimension 20” is very different from any other. But I mean, to you Gabe and Orion who\\'s leading all of these different things and pushing them to feel different, have their own tonality, it\\'s like asking for and pushing all of these different, amazing creators to bring their game and bring something different and unique to each season, and this season definitely was. We\\'ve had a lot, like, not just that art that was very, very unique to the season, but like the props, the banners, which was the first time we\\'ve ever done something that is you know, in-screen art element on top of the dome like that, in addition to all of the hand props, but like a complete re-imagining in this really creative way about what our graphics would even be and the beautiful artwork Bee that gave life to these characters. And integrating that into the graphics, they were, you know, like it all came together and obviously Tyler bringing that all together into the edit itself, it was unique, and it was very \"Dimension 20\" at the same time, and so yeah, props to this whole gang. And Kevin, of course you\\'re the best. We did all these crazy different things. We spotlighted the banners, you know, you\\'re great. (Tyler laughing) All the dome colors, come on. ',\n"," '\\xa0That was really cool. Kevin, you were very yes, and about trying to help with everything. And it made like... There\\'s a terrifying moment of walking into the dome for the first time, not having the same connection to work with all of you, and every one of you being like, \"All right, so what do you need?\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Right, right. Yeah, I definitely pride myself on trying to be as flexible as possible. And I really enjoy being able to accommodate and make everyone\\'s jobs and visions as easy to execute as possible. So I\\'m glad that that all translated well. And to sort of piggyback on how you were mentioning, you know, like on the show, you know, there\\'s a lot that goes on that you don\\'t see and sort of to throw it back to art world. Like, the walls stay the same every time. But for the first time... This was the first time that behind the walls, the entire company changed. Like, this was the first production of \"Dimension 20\" that took place in the new building. ',\n"," '\\xa0Ooh, right. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, so logistically to make that happen, it was a lot there. There was actually quite a lot that was taking place to make all those puzzle pieces fit together. And even though you see the audience sees the same three walls, there was a lot that changed to make it all come together. ',\n"," '\\xa0I momentarily forgot that this was the first in the new studio that we now have. And, yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Pretty interesting fact to think that like behind the walls totally a different story. Everything was so different. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, and Orion was in-person, which was so wonderful and amazing. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yep. ',\n"," '\\xa0Thank God for that. ',\n"," '\\xa0At the new space. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, man. ',\n"," '\\xa0There was a moment Kevin, you were taking a picture of me where I realized what I was doing at the time, so I was thinking that... I was just like, thinking so intensely, thinking about everything that-- ',\n"," \"\\xa0I know and that photo. When I saw that, I'm like I gotta save this because it was so intense. Like, there's all these like photos of like everyone in the dome, and then there's just a flash to darkness and you're like this in the video. \",\n"," \"\\xa0That's too good, I forgot about that. \",\n"," '\\xa0We all have those moments where we just-- ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Mh mh. ',\n"," '\\xa0I\\'ve seen it a thousand times and all the documentaries and I was like, \"Wait, I did the thing.\" ',\n"," \"\\xa0It's official. \",\n"," '\\xa0So you mentioned that this was the first production in the new studio, and with this being the first production, but many different things we did for all of you, what was the biggest unexpected challenge for this season? Because there was a whole bunch of new things happening on-screen and off. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, man. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Heart's at Stake. \",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, wow yeah. ',\n"," \"\\xa0That's definitely the thing for me, because for those of you who don't know, we have the name of the app that we're using to show you all of the information, run through graphics, it's called Hearts at Stake. Just gave it a name so that we could have something to call it. And that became the entire framework of how we were going to run through the show because while everything was going on during production, like we were just all heads down doing everything live. But then it was like, how are we gonna present this information? And thinking about how we were going to do it and arrange everything. And then a lot of Bee's art came into the picture of like, that helps start to shape how things were going, and the art that was going on that we had during production, was kind of the framework for how we started to move into the whole application thing. And so Paula was actually a really like core part of getting us started in post-production and figuring out how we're gonna make things look. And that was... Once we got that like, we hit the ground running. \",\n"," '\\xa0Mh mh. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. That was really fun. I feel like we have this conversation often where it\\'s like, do we use the regular \"Dimension 20\" graphics, or do we make something in-world and completely new? And this season totally warranted stuff that was in-world because we wanted to provide a lot of context throughout the edits. ',\n"," '\\xa0Mh mh. ',\n"," '\\xa0So we didn\\'t wanna keep like dipping in and out of the world of \"Shriek Week.\" So that was so much fun to do. I feel like the whole philosophy that we came up with Orion for the intro and the graphics package of like logging onto hearts at stake, from like a library computer and on campus. That was just so much fun to do. Yeah. ',\n"," \"\\xa0And the multi calls, I love it too. I think this was your idea Orion when we were in post and the reason why we had so many different looks from you Bee was like the app itself is the conduit for the character cards. And so let's have them in different poses, like with different, you know, college backgrounds. (Bee laughing) So it looks like a dating app. And that reinforces the whole idea of this is a dating module, and it's like kids at college and it just... I dunno, it was beautiful and it came together. But very, very different from anything we've done before on the show. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, actually, I\\'ve edited a past season for... I did \"Pirates.\" That was my first time working with the Orion actually, which was really great. But because of the meetings that you guys were having early on, and then as soon as you all figured it out, once I was starting to see what was going on, it definitely changed the edit into going into that style more, and it was very easy to set the tone with all of those elements there, because it was... You know, we\\'d already figured out how we\\'re going to do it. So it was just then... You know, and then also exploring like, okay well, how else can we do this? Should we always have a mouse come and click out? Should it always feel like you\\'re inside the computer or, you know, an audience watching it on that library computer? So that part, it was fun how it all kinda like really fell together. ',\n"," '\\xa0It was like... Tyler, when things got handed off to you, it was like, I\\'m not even like a football person, but just imagine like the perfect pass and a perfect catch. (all laughing) That\\'s what it felt like. We like huddled up and planned everything and like, you\\'re not in the huddle. You\\'re like over there, just waiting. \"Like, I\\'m just gonna catch this, I\\'m just gonna catch this. (Tyler and Katie laughing) It\\'s chucked over and you were like, \"I understand exactly where this is gonna fall, and where to run from here.\" And that was really cool to see, \\'cause it was like, you got it really quickly after we had gone through this meeting of like really trying to capture everything about how we wanna do it. And you just like clicked into the team really fast. And so, as we were working, it was just like MVP moves throughout. So big shout-outs to you Tyler. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Thank you. I don't know sports either, so I got half of that. But thank you so much. (Tyler laughing) \",\n"," \"\\xa0Someone out there's like- \",\n"," \"\\xa0Just in terms... 'Cause in back to that question, Gabe, 'cause Katie was this your first season with us? \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Wow. ',\n"," '\\xa0Wow! ',\n"," \"\\xa0You got thrown through the ringer. I'm sorry, and happy for you. (Orion laughing) \",\n"," '\\xa0It was great. It was wonderful. ',\n"," '\\xa0Amazing. ',\n"," \"\\xa0I had only recently discovered that, about Katie. She told me that the last time she was in town and I was actually very shocked because my impression was that she's been here from the beginning. Like, the way that you just immediately like very easily, like, got into the workflow and you knew what you were doing and very personable and easy to work with. I was like, oh, clearly you're very experienced with the show and you've been here many, many times. So I was fooled. \",\n"," \"\\xa0And I will say, to sing your praises a little bit Katie, and hear a little bit from you, but 'cause new space, right? First time on the job, it's still COVID, especially more so when we were shooting this. That Katie was flying in, and there's a lot of like studio protocols sort of things that are all in place, and Rick is working remotely. I dunno, what was that? What was that like for you, Katie coming in like that? \",\n"," \"\\xa0Actually, I think I'm on the strike. I had like... I didn't end up having COVID or anything, but like I had a cold, and I couldn't come in. Do you remember that? \",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, now I remember.

So like we had someone like a set dresser come in last minute to like attach like the last map, the battle map, he like stapled it down and I had to like write out all these instructions like, I was writing for like a quest.

I think my favorite illustration that you did is Seven's parents, I think. It's like... I love it so much. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Every day I was drawing and I was like, one day closer to drawing Seven's parents. (all laughing) I was just like looking forward to it every night. \",\n"," \"\\xa0You've left a little like the arm things on there too-- \",\n"," \"\\xa0Yes, I'm so glad you noticed. But the thing I did notice is that I think I only gave him six fingers. Oh man, you can't get to seven.(all laughing) \",\n"," \"\\xa0That's why he had a daughter. \",\n"," '\\xa0There you go. ',\n"," \"\\xa0That's how he counts to seven. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh, that's sad. No one tell Dani. I'm gonna get like an angry text, in like an hour. \",\n"," \"\\xa0I love that justification though, 'cause one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. \",\n"," '\\xa0Seven. ',\n"," \"\\xa0I would say it was a really fun process to see the illustrations come in and to see like I was on all those chains, so I could like, if I needed to throw it in like an early version or something, but it was so fun to see like what you came like just off of, you know, out of your mind and then seeing like the little adjustments and everything. It was just a really, really fun process to just observe. 'Cause I was getting to the end. But it's just so fun to observe and see how you took those notes and how you adjust them and what you thought, and like I mean, there was like two, like very different Drusilles at first, and I was like, that was really cool to see which one we were leaning towards and Orion always making sure there was inclusion and it was just a fun process to observe. So I'm glad that I got to be on those emails. \",\n"," \"\\xa0I wanna say also seeing... As the characters were revealed in the first episode, watching the Discord and watching social media, so excited about all of what was happening. The number of people who were like Rafi is a chupacabra with a skateboard that has a Puerto Rican flag on it, acknowledging that it was a Puerto Rican myth. I can think of six people that I've spoken to that were excited about just that. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Yo, Rafi's hot. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yes. ',\n"," '\\xa0Rafi is hot. ',\n"," '\\xa0A lot of people got mad.

I'm like, I'm sorry, just wait. \",\n"," '\\xa0I felt that way. I think I tweeted you. I was like, what happened? ',\n"," '\\xa0You did.',\n"," \"\\xa0What happened to my boy? I mean like every night, another thing I'm under my blankets and I'm like, how am I gonna make the chupacabra hot? \",\n"," '\\xa0And you succeeded, because I remember when you showed up and we were in the Discord, I was just watching \\'cause Gabe\\'s in there just like living it up and people are just like, \"Oh, oh Rafi\\'s hot.\" (all laughing) Every two sentences, I was like, oh no, I\\'m in love with a chupacabra ',\n"," '\\xa0Actually, okay I wanna give shout-out. Who wrote the little captions for the characters that popped up? ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh, that was a Orion. ',\n"," '\\xa0Of course, that was you. (Orion laughing) Of course-- ',\n"," '\\xa0It usually is. ',\n"," '\\xa0When you got gender fluid for Cubie, I literally spit out my drink. ',\n"," '\\xa0As a non-binary person, it is my responsibility to make that joke. There was nothing else available to me at the time.

My favorite one was Frank\\'s and then it was like Sleg\\'s. Like where it was like, the definition was like the half of the sentence, basically. Like, that one was so funny, I thought. Also, you let me do the character slides. Which I was like, oh, that\\'s exciting. So then in the new, like you\\'d like switched a few of them, but like that was fun for me \\'cause I was like, \"Oh, I get to dive into these characters a little bit from watching it.\" You know. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah. That was a lot of fun. Those are probably some of my favorite things to do. And some of the most panic moments you will ever see me in writing because I'm sitting there like this has to be informative and probably funny. So it was like Frank in Stein. Okay (indistinct chatter)\",\n"," '\\xa0Kevin. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yes. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Which character do you feel like you related to the most? And I don't mean to like kinda force a namesake on you, but. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Honestly, I don't know if I can answer just because it has been so long. It's been so long for me since I remember everything that's happened. I honest... I'm so sorry, I don't know how-- \",\n"," \"\\xa0No, that's fine. I'm realizing that there's a character named Kevin and I think I might have named him because I had talked to you that day. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Is that so? That's awesome. I'm very happy to hear that. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Because I've only known one other person named Kevin and I haven't talked to him in three years. So I have not thought about the name and it's just now dawning on me. \",\n"," \"\\xa0I like this because there's currently a trend happening where the D20 season before this one, there was also characters named Kevin that were just... I think, inspired by just me existing. So I'm very happy. This is a trend that is continuing. \",\n"," '\\xa0Maybe the next season will be an all Kevins. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, in fact, I'm gonna put that in a contract. \",\n"," '\\xa0Please do. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oops all Kevin. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oops all Kevins, yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Kevin though, the conversations that we had about lighting and how that turned out in the episodes, this was like super involved lighting wise, especially the last episode. It was so much fun to be sitting there. It was Kerns, Kevin, and I standing next to each other going like, \"Hey, this color would be cool, that color would be cool.\" ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0Hey, here are some things that I can do and all this. And like that was one of the-- ',\n"," '\\xa0I blame some of you for the weird shit that I did because like when I noticed the colors change, there was some chemical change in my brain was like, ah, yes, go ominous, mess with them now.

I didn\\'t ever notice the lighting changes until like I gone out of my moment and I\\'m like, \"Oh God, this mood is very different. This is how I got here.\" ',\n"," \"\\xa0That's awesome, I'm very happy to hear that. \",\n"," \"\\xa0To me, just hearing some of these things, the jargon, like writing the character cards and the lighting and how it affected you Gabe, it just underscores like one of the really awesome things about working on the show, which is like that collaborative. There's just so much room. I mean, it's a huge body of stuff to create, you know, between all of these different elements and just as a really like ripe place to work, and it's so cool to see it all come together too. \",\n"," '\\xa0Well, Rick you did a lot. Like when we were talking and chatting about like the map stuff, I remember sending you a horrible picture of a skull and like, can we make the university look like this? And that ended up being the beautiful Bram University map we have now. My sketch was crap. It was terrible. So the fact that you were able to like make something beautiful out of that, astounded me. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Thank you, yeah. It was really fun. I mean, it just was really fun to work with y'all and you know, to see where it ended up, you know, like we... I think when we started it, we were calling it monster dating or something like that. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, yup. ',\n"," \"\\xa0And also when we were working on it, all of the graphic framing and the dating app and all that stuff didn't really exist yet. \",\n"," \"\\xa0That's true. \",\n"," \"\\xa0It's so cool to... You know, as I was working on other things and seeing that come up in emails and slacks and stuff, was like oh wow, this is so cool, that y'all, picked the show and then vibed off of it and interpreted in this kind of like holistic like vision that sort of brought it all. It was inspired, I thought was really cool, yeah. \",\n"," \"\\xa0That just reminds me in the art world, in the formation of this overall 'cause there's obviously college and dating and relationships. There weren't any battles, battles, but we still had this from you, Gabe and Orion, like having the idea of a map in order... That's a college campus map that grounds us, but then integrating that in the art world and a new way that we've never done before, we still have a map on the table that we can use, that the players can interact with, but is distinctly different from any sort of like battle map type of scenario that we've had in the past. And that coming into fruition from creatively and artistically from like, how are we gonna manipulate that? We're gonna have this map and people can move around their own pieces, but it's more like figuratively, where they are, but it integrates them to this time and place. I dunno, I kinda seeing it, observing that and being a part of that whole conversation was really cool to see. \",\n"," \"\\xa0So Paula, you lead doing the graphic design. You made a lot of like the visuals really come together for that end result, which they were gorgeous. Like, it... I didn't know what to expect and it was beyond anything that I could have expected. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh man, thanks. It was super, super fun to do. And again, it was totally unique to any other season. Just because we made this choice to link it so directly to the content and make it in-world and give it this perspective and stuff. The intro was really fun to work on too. And we kinda struggled with like, is this like... Are all these kinda graphics gonna come out of a field? Is it gonna feel really weird? Are people gonna be lost? But we kinda looked at the intro as a way to establish like, okay, we're on a computer, this is what we're doing. Set the tone for all the graphics and stuff. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, that was super fun to do. A lot of hidden gems from Orion in there too. Can you talk about like last minute like, coffee jokes, that's just jam packed. (Paula laughing) \",\n"," \"\\xa0Just pause and check it out. I don't remember. Those are fever dreams to me. They're always like, can you get some copy on this? Oh boy. And it works out at the end. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh yeah, it totally does. It's great. \",\n"," '\\xa0It was actually really fun and very terrifying to do the intro, voice acting, doing the voiceover–',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh yeah oh my God, I forgot that's you. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Hidden jem, it's a real jem. \",\n"," '\\xa0I\\'m so glad that like I got through that and I got not a single message from a single person being like, \"Hey, that\\'s you.\" Because then I would\\'ve disappeared. (all laughing) Speaking of the VO, it was really, really fun to write that out with you Gabe, and work with an orient as well, who y\\'all together, getting to go through and record these lines and get a bunch of takes on them and everything. And then hear it on episode one, with that radio, like over the wire sort of sound effect to it. Sounded so perfect. Like it really hit that note, just like flawlessly. I\\'m really glad that we went with doing a little bit of fun voiceover college stuff, \\'cause a lot of new stuff in a season. It\\'s like a ton. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, okay. That\\'s that\\'s even... So like Rick, Paula, and Katie. D says, “I love so much of the artistic direction in this season, from the early web 1.0 popups and aesthetics to the dating profile imagery, to the unique look of the maps and even actual printouts. It seems to be one of the more involved seasons for the art team. What led to the decisions to have more visual graphics throughout, and to kind of break them from a precedent versus like what character screens on \"Dimension 20\" might\\'ve looked like traditionally in the past?” ',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh yeah, go ahead. I think that we are... Orion, you had come to like post early on kinda after the shoot and it was like, okay we know that we were gonna want to provide context throughout gameplay, like, and how do we do that in a way that doesn't interrupt the flow and keeps things exciting and like, kind of like just fits in seamlessly? So for me, it was part of like problem-solving how to do that, and knowing that the context would come and like... The contextual information would come in like many different forms, like it would be written out as text or an image, or it would be about the character. So that was kind of how we approached it, like solving that problem. Yeah. \",\n"," \"\\xa0From our side at the beginning, it was like a modern setting. So there's like, you know, gonna be school logos, and school colors, and mascot. And it just immediately, there was a lot of like kinda graphic world building stuff. And Paula had helped us with a ton of that establishing all that kinda look and stuff. And then knowing that, you know, well, there's no battles in that sense, there's no battle map or miniatures, but how do we kind of create like a game board or like some way to like, you know, have that element in there and have maybe it's props you know, and these flyers and a schedule and all this kinda stuff, which Katie actually made a ton of stuff and the jackets which I think was-- \",\n"," '\\xa0Oh, that was a national effort. The jackets were purchased in Brooklyn and a woman in Virginia, like embroidered them and then a woman in Burbank sewed them on. Because trying to find leatherman jackets in the summer, it turns out, yeah. Anyway, sorry to cut you off Rick. ',\n"," \"\\xa0No, no and didn't you get the little Hans Dahl desk- \",\n"," '\\xa0Yes, I went to the coolest, like old Brooklyn trophy shop and I was like, \"I got a job for you guys.\" And like, to get this little plate engraved \\'cause that\\'s the place to go if you need tiny engraving. And they were like, that\\'s weird, but all right. (Katie and Kevin laughing) And they made it and I just put it in my suitcase. It\\'s like, okay, here we go. Don\\'t drop that. And then Rick made the wedge and mailed it. The little wooden thing that goes on and he mailed it down. And then at the studio, I just, you know, glued it on. ',\n"," '\\xa0Wow. ',\n"," '\\xa0How the collaborations. ',\n"," '\\xa0Think they Were expecting you to come in with like an \"Ocean\\'s 11\" job and then there were like, oh no, the thing we do here in this building. (Katie laughing) ',\n"," '\\xa0I love the flyers. Sorry Gabe. ',\n"," \"\\xa0No that's fine. \",\n"," '\\xa0Thank you. ',\n"," '\\xa0I love the added touch of flyers. I feel like it makes it feel like a campus in a really specific way. Like, especially too that they were like black and white, you know, quickly xeroxed kinda thing. I love them. ',\n"," '\\xa0I love them too. ',\n"," '\\xa0No, go ahead. ',\n"," \"\\xa0I'm sorry. I love making props where you kinda get to like inhabit the world of whoever like fictionally made them. I was like, all right, I'm a college kid, maybe I have Photoshop, maybe I don't. I'm also a monster. (Katie and Paula laughing) \",\n"," '\\xa0What monster were you? ',\n"," \"\\xa0Oh what monster did I pretend to be in my prop making method? I don't know, maybe a skeleton. But those are like the storytelling props. They are really so fun. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Like I even said before that everyone was just, yes and. I asked for some weird shit, and everyone just kept saying, yeah we'll see what we can do, or like, yes. 'Cause I was like, can we have like a schedule, you guys are like a'ight. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0My God, what? ',\n"," '\\xa0That was fun too. ',\n"," \"\\xa0And the schedule was cool. 'Cause then like they even like wrote notes or like things that they wanted to do during the days. And honestly Orion like when you and I were talking concepts for these characters Bee I'm impressed and sorry that you had to draw some of those weird. So like Bee. So somebody even asks. Yack, “Bee love your work. My question is, how did you come up with the art and illustration design for each character and background? Like any advice?” Because we gave you weird shit. We gave you some descriptors. \",\n"," '\\xa0It was so weird. ',\n"," '\\xa0Oh yeah, oh yeah. ',\n"," '\\xa0And we were like, hey-- ',\n"," '\\xa0Thank you for being able to interpret like the absolutely bananas stuff that comes out of my mouth. ',\n"," \"\\xa0'Cause like, just from a back end point, Orion like when we got art back, we barely changed anything. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah. ',\n"," \"\\xa0We'd be like, great, next one. \",\n"," \"\\xa0I mean, that was wonderful for me. You both were just the best cheerleaders. Like I came out of this, just feeling so much better and great. And also thank you Yack. But yeah, I mean the weirder it was, was actually the most fun I had. Like, I'm like, how am I gonna put these Jordans on Terry's big ass hoof feet without him looking like a clown? It just cuts out the bottom, I guess. And of course, Seven's parents were, I mean, it was my favorite thing to do. It was... I'll probably put it on my tombstone. (all laughing) But Orion, you gave me the best descriptors for these characters. I wish I could find my notes because they would probably make no sense but-- \",\n"," \"\\xa0They make no sense. I just got the vibe that you wouldn't understand so I let loose. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, I think for Rafi, you said everyone's into him, I don't know why, like it doesn't make sense. Just everyone's into him. \",\n"," \"\\xa0And everyone's into him. \",\n"," '\\xa0There you got that. ',\n"," '\\xa0You got it. You get me psychically. ',\n"," '\\xa0It was just wonderful notes. I remember we had a little meeting where we just went through each character and everyone just had these little bizarre notes. If I can find them, I was drawing in the margins. It was just such a great time. I fed off of your energy, like both of your energy. It brought the characters to life, and they were all really fun to draw. ',\n"," \"\\xa0So Orion actually, and I'm gonna lead into this with you. There was a bunch of characters in this show that even some that I forgot. Orion, do you remember me texting you, asking who Frank was? (Gabe and Orion laughing) 'Cause when Bee gave us art of Frank, I literally texted Orion and I was like, who is that? \",\n"," \"\\xa0Who's Frank? Yes, yes absolutely. \",\n"," \"\\xa0You're not gonna know who Frank is, name's Frank. \",\n"," '\\xa0I missed a lot of what I said. It was kinda like a fever dream. ',\n"," \"\\xa0I'm gonna turn this around and put on you because you went in there with a plan and then just built the ship as you were flying it because of all of the curve balls that they were throwing. 'Cause like we had organized... The show was really organized, so much more around the events that we had. 'Cause we had both main events for the group that these are just things that are gonna happen. But then it also asks, Hey, are there any events that you would like to have in it 'cause then your character can go there and be interested in it and stuff like that? So like, the art walk and the clothing swap were both events that were brought in by the characters, by the players. But as soon as we got into it, and things started moving around, of course the players, you know, they catch a lead, they wanna go in one direction or another. And after just about every episode Gabe, you would like come up to you and be like, I have no idea what just happened. I don't remember what I just did. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Orion, they didn't do the thing. 'Cause we... Honestly like a third of the Shriek Week NPCs that you meet were not planned. Kevin didn't exist. The plant didn't exist. Teddy didn't exist. \",\n"," '\\xa0Teddy did not exist, yes. (Orion and Gabe laughing) ',\n"," '\\xa0Who became a major part of this story. ',\n"," '\\xa0I love that they focused on the ones like, for some reason they were just so sure that Kevin was like the big, bad. ',\n"," '\\xa0Yeah.',\n"," \"\\xa0It was like, no, actually it's the other one you made up. It's the one you bit. (indistinct chatter) \",\n"," \"\\xa0They turn him into a thrall. And then I... My favorite... Well, one of them. One of my favorite lines that I did was when Seven said you're free to do what you want. And I was just, oh good. Because that was when I knew that he was gonna go do some weird shit. \",\n"," '\\xa0That was the moment everything changed. And we all saw in your face. ',\n"," \"\\xa0And the thing that blows my mind, no one found Frank's head. That Teddy took Frank's head and ran away and came back without it. And everyone forgot. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, that was episode one. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Yes. They found Frank's legs. And then gave up.

What's even happening? Okay, so for any of you, actually, what is a moment that when you were going through and watching and seeing what was happening, what was the moment that actually threw you off of anything? Whether it was like a story or like seeing how everything came together. 'Cause this was like Orion said we were basically building the ship as it was sailing. And it was just twists and turns, and essentially like Tyler, as you were editing, I know you had to see some weird things we said, Paula, the fact that you had to make graphics for half the bullshit that we were mentioning, bless your soul. \",\n"," '\\xa0It was the fly.

Like Ally desperately doesn't want this fly to die. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Oh that's right. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, Ally was like, no, we can't do that. Don't hurt it. And like, it was like this whole thing that like, I think Lily was trying to go through probably something emotional at the time. It was just like, it felt like everyone... Everything had kind of like just gone off kilter because this one fly was just trying to land on that. \",\n"," '\\xa0Was that the breakup scene? ',\n"," \"\\xa0It was definitely episode four. It was definitely episode four 'cause I remember Ify in his letterman like smacking the tables. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Viewers at home, there was a fly in the dome, which is crazy because the dome is in its current iteration is not a full-blown room since fly could have, should have left a while back. But kept on coming in and out of conversation 'cause it was like gameplay would happen and the story would go on and this fly would come back and then it became like a running joke for the players outside of the game. And Ify finally killed it, but then there was a burial for the fly-- \",\n"," \"\\xa0There was a burial, that's right. As they were trying to get it off, they ended up like they were trying to pick it up with the paper and it ended up falling in between like the border and the map went in.

(Orion laughing) You know what? And I think it was like, how are we... Like Dani was so adamant that it was Ted, and also she like... There\\'s that moment where she\\'s like, \"Oh, hey Todd.\" And like, we ended up being like, oh wait a second, it\\'s hilarious that she doesn\\'t know the actual name of him and let\\'s just run with it. But then my favorite part actually Gabe was when Lily\\'s like, is it Ted, is Todd? And you were just like, yeah no Ted. Like it was like, you just squash it and it\\'s like okay, no-- ',\n"," \"\\xa0So Tyler, I'm gonna confess to you. I'm gonna confess to you.

I'm like, his name is Ted Todd. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Ted Todd, right? Because then also Ally had something like later where they referenced like at some sort of rhyme and ended up with Todd and I was like, oh no, is that gonna make sense? And so I think we thought about like, we're gonna cut it or not like just those little things where you're like, you know, 'cause like you said, you did go off on a lot of things that were very much improvised and on and off the cuff. And so sometimes it's about making sure that we're staying in that lane because some of the other expedition just doesn't necessarily make sense. \",\n"," '\\xa0It became an accidental thing because ironically the only one they referred to as Ted and Todd was the 13th Teddy. So he became like Teddy Todd. But then when they met the new ones, they were all just Teddy. ',\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, yeah. I feel like someone called him Theodore at one point too and I was like, that's cool. \",\n"," '\\xa0What? (all laughing) I would not be shocked. This was the... You know, bless Ify. But the way that man described things, I also... Tyler, how dare you? How dare you do a Zoom in on my face after Ify describes eating ass after a backrub? (all laughing) ',\n"," \"\\xa0It was too good. Your face was so good, there's no way we're making this. \",\n"," \"\\xa0I'm still shocked. 'Cause I was like, wow, we can really just get away with it. All right. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Or also you at the beginning too, one of the episodes we were like, thank you for letting us do this still. When they're like talking about the ass eating, like-- \",\n"," '\\xa0Yes. ',\n"," '\\xa0You know, and then we have Lily like making the faces. It was great. ',\n"," \"\\xa0So Orion, this is pretty easy. Someone had actually asked... Snow, they asked if monster high but adults was like really any inspiration for this. And I don't think it was, we had really just talked about wanting monster dating and then we went on to college 'cause college is the time when people can be adults, but it's a good reason for them to be in the same place. I feel like doing monster dating in the city would be hard as hell 'cause they can just get in a car and leave. And I don't wanna have to deal with that. \",\n"," \"\\xa0Yeah, it's one of those things where it's more fun when you have to show up to a place where you see people all the time. So whatever happens in those relationships just sticks. So it's like we've used school a lot. \",\n"," '\\xa0Yeah, next time it can be in an office.

Gang, last we left off, the champions of New York City found themselves on top of a rusty old hot dog cart helping a group of cockroach monks defend their monastery, the Monastery of the Sacred Rat, a temple devoted to the monastic contemplation of the divine mysteries of Rat Jesus, AKA Kugrash, AKA Bruce Kugrich. However, their monastery was beset by legions of ants. Thankfully, the champions of New York City were able to defend the monastery and find the third missing spirit of New York City, Marty the juicy cockroach, who, in addition to Perry the pigeon and the unicorn of the Cloisters, comprise the three spirits whom Kugrash called upon for his druidic powers all the way back in the 90s, after these three spirits were created and set in place to look after the overlooked and forgotten of New York by the Dragon of Bleecker Street, who chose another champion other than these three spirits in a young Kingston Brown back in the 90s. Also, this day, by the way, this day is the Sunday after Thanksgiving, which is how much has happened in the past couple of days. You guys also went into Nod, where Pete the Vox Phantasma named Null, the entity of isolation, erasure, and forgetting that is moving like vast cosmic void upon the sixth borough and New York City itself. Pete named Null, provoking its attack but also giving you guys a way to understand it and fight it, at the same time as Iga took Kingston into her chest and discovered the secret at the heart of her family's mythic castle, the dragon Smoczmatka, who had been imprisoned there for centuries, and Iga chose to free the dragon, ending 1,200 years of this warlock's dominion over this being. In addition, an egg was discovered that was the rambunctious egg who had been changing the surface of the chest in the first place, and this beautiful, gilded, graffiti covered egg was given to Kingston Brown to safeguard. At the end of last session, you guys went up onto one of the old napkin shelves in the top of the hot dog cart, you guys are all still very itty bitty, and communed with the eternal rat himself, and, scintillating in starlight and smelling like pure shit, Kugrash appeared. And that's where we're gonna pick up our game. The six of you look forward and see the constellation of stars comprising a fraction of the infinite essence of Kugrash. What do you do as you behold your infinite old friend?\",\n"," ' Kug? Can you hear us?',\n"," \" Of course I can hear you, Sof. I would ask you how it's going, but I know how it's going, and, uh, yeah.\",\n"," \" Okay! Well, I guess I don't know how you're doing. How are you?\",\n"," \" I'm, you know, everything. Good, bad, shitty, great, awesome, terrible, just everything at once. It's awesome by the definition of awesome, you know what I mean?

Obviously you know, it feels stupid to give any sort of exposition to you, but we came here because of that-\",\n"," \" No, you know, I know a lot of stuff, but I never know, you know, I don't know the future, I don't know the next thing, you know, that you're gonna say necessarily. I can make educated guesses, but I don't know everything, so you know, you can ask me a question, I'm still Kugrash.\",\n"," ' Yeah, I mean, I-',\n"," ' What are you eating?',\n"," ' I am eating a different bagel, not the-[Brennan laughs]',\n"," ' I am glad that you developed a taste for it.',\n"," ' Yeah, I think I look at Pete and Kingston and just say, ',\n"," \" I think we're just looking for anything that will help us take on this threat to both the dreaming and the waking world.\",\n"," ' Yeah. What do you know about Null, if anything?',\n"," \" I know a lot of what you guys have come to know, that Null is older than any of the other beings, that it was kind of the first, it's nothing. It existed before gods, it existed before anything, and he's a monarch of the Dreaming, and its ultimate goal is to consume everything, basically consolidate all of time down to just a single moment, just, you know, get back to nothingness. Now, the reason Null wasn't able to get to New York in the past was because of the three spirits, who I kind of at the time I didn't, you know, understand the significance of them, I just thought hey, cool, spicy pigeon, juicy cockroach, unicorn, you know, this'll help me help the people of New York out. But they were quite significant, and that helped, you know, take care of the forgotten people around New York and Null wasn't able to get here, and the only reason that the spirits are alive still after I died is 'cause of Ricky, for taking up the mantle. So thanks for that, Rick.\",\n"," \" Hey, no problem. It's been fun. It's honestly great. I didn't realize that that would be part of it, and it's been interesting having them connected to me.\",\n"," \" Yeah, I sense that you're not loving the aesthetic, but generally you like the vibes, but not the aesthetic.\",\n"," ' The vibes are amazing.',\n"," \" Right, yeah. Yeah, you'll learn to love this shit. At first when I was living in the sewer, I'm like, ah, I'm a fucking rat, this is fucking weird! I used to live in like a cool-ass condo, and now I live in the sewer. But, you know, the sewer's, you know, there's a lot of cool literal shit in there, so.\",\n"," \" I guess I'm struggling with why I would have to be in the sewer as much as maybe you were.\",\n"," \" Right, no, well that's optional, you don't have to go in the sewer. You might have to go to the sewer. You might have to go to the sewer, you don't have to live in the sewer.\",\n"," ' Right.',\n"," ' If that makes sense.',\n"," \" Okay, that's huge, that's great, that's cool.\",\n"," \" Yeah, you don't have to be exactly like me, I was a rat man who would freak people out whenever I came out. You are a very handsome man, you beautiful bastard.\",\n"," \" Well, I mean, Kugrash, I don't want to jump the gun, but, like, what do I do with this stuff? I mean, it's weird to have, I don't… I would be lying if I said I fully understood it, but I don't know if you had any advice for me on that.\",\n"," \" I mean, you're doing all the right things so far. You kind of awakened the spirits again. They were weakened when I died, but now they're back with Perry and the juicy cockroach, and once you bring them all together, I think you'll be able to do a lot of good. Getting back to what I was talking about before, before Ricky and before I kind of protected the city, there was the Dragon of Bleecker Street, and dragons are the antithesis of something like Null, 'cause dragons collect things. Like, those are memories. Those were all powerful things. That is the opposite of Null. So Null could not get in while the Dragon of Bleecker Street was here.\",\n"," ' Did the dragon die naturally, or did Null kill the dragon?',\n"," \" The dragon… Oh, wow, you kind of stumped me here, Pete, in like a weird way, because the answer is both, if that makes sense? Which is, dragons can die if their hoard is incomplete, and the thing about the Dragon of Bleecker Street is that at sort of the beginning of his life, he only cared about kind of the big, like, glorious, you know, heroic, big, magical things about New York, but wasn't as interested in, you know, the smaller, everyday things, and, you know, because of that, he either forgot about or lost or gave away certain items from his hoard that ended up being pretty important, that Null has since—\",\n"," ' Destroyed?',\n"," \" Erased. Erased, to a certain extent. They're not completely gone, because I still kind of remember that they exist. I know that there's seven things that are missing from the Dragon of Bleecker Street's hoard. Emily and Ally’s jaws drop. Lou and Ally’s eyes go wide.\",\n"," ' One of them—',\n"," ' And—',\n"," ' Can—\\xa0Yeah, can you give us those?',\n"," \" Excuse me, let me get a piece of paper and a pencil. Oh wow, this pencil's so big!\",\n"," \" We're all working to use a pencil together.\",\n"," \" Watching your guys' face when Murph gave you guys a hard number light up like fucking Christmas trees was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.[Emily laughs]\",\n"," \" I mean, in fantasy, when you hear that there's seven anything, you're like, and that’s what we need!\",\n"," ' Yeah, baby, we got to collect them.',\n"," ' At the very least write them down.',\n"," \" Anyways, yeah, we're all using one big pencil to write it down.\",\n"," \" We're all using one big pencil, we're writing on a napkin.\",\n"," ' The Chinese takeout chopsticks of destiny.',\n"," ' Okay, Kug, lay it on us.',\n"," \" Right. So, the only one that I can remember fully is Peter Stuyvesant's wooden leg. That was one of them. I remember that one specifically. The other six are more kind of vague, which means that maybe somebody else remembers them in some kind of vague way or something, I'm not entirely sure what it means. But there's a candle, a coin, a bouquet, a scrap of paper, a baseball, and a cymbal, like a musical cymbal, not just, you know, a symbol of something.\",\n"," \" Yeah, yeah, there's symbolism in the cymbal, yeah yeah.\",\n"," \" Exactly, yes. A cymbal that's a symbol, as it were.\",\n"," \" Kug, do you think it's-\",\n"," ' C Y M B A L?',\n"," ' Yes.',\n"," \" We're all, again, all spelling this at the same time.\",\n"," ' How do you spell Stuyvesant?\\xa0S… T… ',\n"," ' We started to misspell “cymbal” and we just decided fuck it.',\n"," ' Now we have to like-',\n"," ' Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around!',\n"," \" Here's the thing, I'm actually not that good at spelling, 'cause I hear, you know, like the bad spellers just as much as I hear the good spellers, so it's just a mess, it's just a mess in here.\",\n"," ' I mean, I think spelling and language in general is kind of something that you agree upon as a culture.',\n"," '\\xa0That’s true.',\n"," ' Yeah, words are made up, right?',\n"," \" That's true. Anyway. So the dragon got sick and eventually passed away because of these missing items, and at the end of his life, when Kingston met him, was having regrets about not valuing kind of the smaller things about life in New York, so that is when the Dragon of Bleecker Street created the spicy pigeon, the juicy cockroach, and the unicorn.\",\n"," \" Aw, I mean, the unicorn's obvious, not appreciating the pigeon and the rat, that makes sense.\",\n"," ' Well they, yeah, the unicorn I think is, you know, a representation of the magical things, and then the spicy pigeon and the juicy cockroach are representative of juicy cockroaches and spicy pigeons, of which there are many. So the best way to defeat Null is for you all to hatch a new dragon to recreate the hoard of the Dragon of Bleecker Street and once again protect it from Null.',\n"," \" Kug, I have a question. The fact that some of them are more difficult to remember, do you have any idea if these items have been taken deeper into the Dreaming, or if it's just a general erasing effect? Is it like a proximity thing? Like, are they hard to remember because they've been taken so deep?\",\n"," \" I'm not exactly sure where they are.\",\n"," ' Okay.',\n"," ' Null has gotten to them in some way for me to have forgotten them. They may fully be destroyed in the present.',\n"," ' Okay.',\n"," \" But there might still be a way to get to them, 'cause the fact that I still remember them means that somebody else does.\",\n"," \" Do you know if Peter had another leg? Did he replace it, or… I'm just wondering at what point... Is Peter okay?\",\n"," ' Is Peter, dude, Peter is—',\n"," ' Peter Stuyvesant is from really long ago.',\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," \" Ricky, I'm so sorry, Peter is dead.Ricky turns away and lowers his head.\",\n"," ' He is very dead.',\n"," ' I hug Ricky.',\n"," \" He is from New Amsterdam, Ricky! He's not even from New York, he's from New Amsterdam.\",\n"," ' He lived a good life. He did great things.',\n"," ' [nods] Okay. Okay.',\n"," ' If you want, we can look up a Peter Stuyvesant in the phone book and just go check up on them.',\n"," \" But if you wanted to talk to somebody other than me about all this, the Dragon of Bleecker Street was brought to New York in the late 1800s by the Shen family. They're a family of sorcerers that are still living in Chinatown, so they're still here.\",\n"," ' Wait, the Manhattan Chinatown or the Queens Chinatown?',\n"," ' The Manhattan Chinatown.',\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," ' Okay.',\n"," ' Brennan, have I met anyone in the Shen family?',\n"," \" I'm gonna say that Kingston absolutely knows the Shen family.\",\n"," \" I know the Shen family, we got an in. Don't even worry about it. Kug, can we, like, will this struggle with Null be forever, or is Null something we can vanquish or, I don't know. Is this going to be just a new forever, or I don't know, how bad can we beat this thing?\",\n"," \" So there's two parts of this, right? Gladiator is very real. Gladiator is an actual company that exists in the waking world. It is not created by Null, it is an actual company that is buying up property and, you know, destroying a lot of neighborhoods, and Null is simply taking advantage of that. There are people who are possessed by Null, but they're only being possessed because they have holes in them. They're, you know, rich people who are trying to collect money when they couldn't possibly need more, they're people who, you know, are vulnerable, who hate their jobs, who feel soulless, and Null is taking advantage of that. So in the waking world, you have to fight Gladiator tooth and nail in any way you can, and on the dream side of it, you need a fucking dragon.\",\n"," ' Okay, wow, that is descriptive.',\n"," ' Do you know the AC of their robots?',\n"," ' Thank you, Ricky, thank you. Thank you, Ricky.',\n"," ' Do they have resistances to any kind of damage, any vulnerabilities?',\n"," ' Of course I know the AC of their robots.',\n"," ' Kug, I was wondering, do you know who is possessed by Null when it comes to Gladiator?',\n"," \" So it's not an… When you talk to sort of weird dudes in suits and they have static coming out of their mouths, that is them being possessed by Null. They are not necessarily all day every day, you know, zombies of Null, they are ruthless business people who, at times, are having kind of their emotions manipulated to, you know, buy up more ad space, to buy more apartment buildings. So on the Gladiator side of things, it's less about going and just like, you know, there's no wizard who is running Gladiator, if that makes sense.\",\n"," \" Yeah. I have a question, but I don't know if this is an ask Kugrash question, but I'm just wondering, like—\",\n"," ' I have a question for Kugrash, too.',\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," \" Like, mechanically-wise, like this world that you've set up, is there like any incentive for these people to embrace Null? Is there some sort of like power that they're getting?\",\n"," ' I think Pete can, in the weird void here, make an arcana check, because you have a connection to Null. So as Kugrash is saying like, yeah, go ahead and have Pete give me, and because of your infinite power right now, go ahead and give me an arcana check with advantage.',\n"," ' Okay. Ooh, that is a 22.',\n"," \" 22, hell yeah. As Kugrash talks about the nature of Null and Gladiator, Pete made contact with this entity. You touched Null, and you haven't really gotten a sense of Gladiator until you reach out from void here, from this like, Kugrash is sort of the other side of the coin, so to speak.\",\n"," ' Hell yes.',\n"," ' Of like a positive void.',\n"," \" Cody's just nodding at Kugrash.\",\n"," \" Yeah, Cody's nodding the whole time.\",\n"," \" You reach out and realize that Nod was mistaken about the nature of Null and these older siblings out in the deep Dreaming. Nod was like, they stay away from the waking world, and that's true, they don't go to places like the sixth borough that are these kind of coral reefs close to the shore, right? What you realize is that these other beings do have ways of interacting in the waking world. For lack of a better word, Gladiator is the Vox Phantasma of Null, but Null would never choose an individual that could understand it, right? 'Cause that's the thing Null doesn't want. Null doesn't want to be named, doesn't want to be understood, it doesn't want to even be perceived, right?\",\n"," ' It needs mindless workers.',\n"," ' Mindless. And it gets more powerful the more people are unaware of it, right? So its perfect champion would never be a person, its perfect champion would be a complex series of relationships. It would be an organization, a structure, a system in which every person could seek to bring it about into the waking world without ever being aware of it. And when Kugrash describes these little bits of static, which, by the way, Kingston saw, you had that vision of someone\\'s eyes going static for a moment, you\\'re realizing that Null wouldn\\'t take people over in this like force of wills like a demonic possession, like, \"I\\'m fighting, but I\\'m being taken over!\" It would take people over in the moments where they went on autopilot. It would take people over like when you\\'re not thinking while you\\'re driving. It would take people over in the moments where you\\'re not in full awareness of the actions you\\'re taking or what they mean or what they signify. Lack of awareness is, of course, the place that this extra-planar entity operates from. So I think-',\n"," \" So it's not like a possession, it's more like a carbon monoxide leak.\",\n"," '\\xa0[laughs]\\xa0Yes.',\n"," ' Or like you know, like yeah.',\n"," ' That\\'s the thing is, Pete, you would still describe it as a possession, it is working its terrible influence on the world, but it is the equivalent of a carbon monoxide leak rather than a lethal injection. It\\'s happening in ambient, it\\'s happening in negative space. It doesn\\'t need to possess one person for their whole life and create an evil cultist wizard that you guys could just go behead in one fight and now Gladiator is good. Why possess one person when you could ambiently possess people, each of them a couple minutes a day, in moments where they\\'re not paying attention over an entire global corporation? So it\\'s way scarier than a cabal of seven executives that each consciously want to bring about the end of the world. If you guys went and killed the CEO of Gladiator, Null would find the secret spaces in the mind of whoever got appointed CEO next, and it is rather this organization and all of those empty spaces in the relationships between people that are the puppet Null is wielding in the material world. So it is a very real, magical, extra-planar threat, but it is this weird, I think Pete would probably think of, like, weird, techno, like, hive mind shit. You know, like, for lack of a better word, like the scariest thing about like the agents in \"The Matrix\" was that any single person could become them at a moment, and that seems to be the way Null is working, of like, oh, I can just become whoever I need to be in the moment, because I\\'m spread out, you know, in this haze, a lot like the Umbral Arcana. Like, I\\'m ambiently everywhere all the time.',\n"," ' With that arcana check, would I know if we have all been touched by Null at some point in our lives? Is it something like that? Like, anyone?',\n"," \" With that 22, I think Pete wouldn't know that for certain, but would definitely have cause to fear that. Because Null looks for the empty places not only inside of cities and corporations, but also inside of people, and I think that Pete might very well be like, you know, maybe not to the scale of having your eyes go static and moving to like buy the Central Park Carousel, you know, but like maybe on the scale of, like, momentary lapses in judgment, bad decisions, moments where you lose your connection to something, yeah. You think probably you have been possessed by Null in fractions of a second throughout many different points in your life.\",\n"," ' Wow. Cool.',\n"," \" Can I, okay, so this sort of, it doesn't hit close to home, it just makes me think of something. Kug, is there some kind of good version of Null? Because, I mean, I say this as someone who, you know, the Order of the Concrete Fist introduced me to, you know, meditation, and a lot of that is going to a place of nothingness so that you can better grapple with the past and the future, and so I'm curious if there's a good form of Null, or if there's an amount of Null that's okay, or what that means. Because a lot of times, the past and the present encroach, I mean the past and the future encroach on the present, you know?\",\n"," ' Right.

Yeah, I guess I'm just curious what that is, then.\",\n"," \" 'Cause I know for me, meditating is like mindfulness, or like getting in touch with what I'm feeling and stuff and it does feel different than when I'm just kind of in a haze and not really caring about the week.\",\n"," ' Mindful versus mindless.',\n"," ' Yeah.',\n"," \" I think that there's, like, a lot of different types of meditation though, and some are, like, some of it is tuning into your present and some of it is finding a nothingness.

So I don't know, I guess I just was curious if there was a good nothingness.\",\n"," ' Yeah, I mean, the, like, being completely in the present moment and just taking things in is different than mindlessly sitting at your desk and forgetting why you woke up in the morning.',\n"," ' Mm-hm, yeah.',\n"," ' I would say if Sofia wants to make either a religion or an insight check in this moment, go for it.',\n"," ' Okay.',\n"," ' Can I give her the help action?',\n"," ' Sure, yeah yeah yeah.',\n"," ' Okay.

I think that with sort of that roll, I think Sofia probably is living in confusion in this moment around whether there is a good version of this, and also the interesting thing about when you are concentrating on nothingness, when you are clearing your mind, the relationship between the idea of true nothingness, but then also the ability, when you're meditating on nothing, the idea of unity, because the number that is closest to zero is one, and there is a degree of meditation where you are getting rid of everything, because you're realizing that everything isn't nothing, but it is just one thing, and you're erasing those boundaries between you and your connection to everything else. I think that maybe Sofia is sort of like observing, like, what is the difference between everything and nothing? And like, it's a very like monk-like meditation. That's sort of like, I don't think there's a solution to that.

Yeah, so I think Sofia, you have that meditation, and Pete you have that recognition of Gladiator's relationship, that like Null moves in extremely hard to combat ways. They're very ambient, they're not gonna make the mistake of like giving you guys one human champion that you can kill and then Null is, like, fucked.
