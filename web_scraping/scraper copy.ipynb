      "Ally: I see \n",
      "Brennan: I will tell you where I live now is a Denny's parking lot. So that's what's going on with me. First of all, I just wanna say a couple things. First of all, can we get a big round of applause for Mr, Zac Oyama. \n",
      "(all clapping) (screams) \n",
      "Siobhan: R.I.P.\n",
      "Brennan: R.I.P. for Lapin Cadbury. Guys this is the show where we talk about all things Dimension 20, especially the preceding episode of The Crown of Candy which just ended a little over an hour ago. I also want to welcome for the first time in a little while let's say hi to Emily Axford and Brian Murphy. \n",

      "(screams) \n",
      "Murph: Thank you. \n",
      "Emily: It was perfect. \n",
      "Brennan: For the I guess five or six of you that don't fall in the middle of the NADDPOD Dimension 20 Venn diagram, please go check out, you can now binge all 100 episodes of the Band of Boubs and their adventures in Bahumia \n",
      "Siobhan: An insane binge, a full month of listening (mumbles). \n",
      "Zac: What are you doing? You don't have anything else to do? \n",
      "Brennan: Binge that, come on baby if you're a completionist get the story. It's all there. \n",
      "Siobhan: Play Animal Crossing and NADDPOD at the same time. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah baby. \n",
      "Brennan: 100%. So, what I want to jump into first and foremost and, obviously we have a lot to talk about \n",
      "Zac: Hang on Brennan. I have just started seeing some bunny ears in the back of your frame. \n",
      "Brennan: Oh, those actually, they're there? \n",
      "Lou: What the fuck dude. \n",
      "Zac: What's that about dude? \n",
      "Siobhan: Rip those bunny ears off a bunny dude?  \n",
      "Lou: What's that about? \n",
      "Ally: Wow\n",
      "Brennan: Yikes, well again, we're gonna be getting into today we have a lot of bunny feelings to process. First and foremost, rewatching this episode, I forgot how tense this episode was. Beardsley said it best with. We're at a warehouse in Hollywood at 1 a.m. \n",
      "(laughs)\n",
      "which is wild. But I also wanna dive in and talk a little bit about the big thing and I got obviously spoilers all the way for everyone watching. We're gonna be talking about episode six of The Crown of Candy, let's just cut straight to the chase. The first PC permadeath in Dimension 20 history, handled as such, I've gone through as such, we've had characters dropped to zero before spoilers for Season One Fantasy High. But we have some PC deaths in the very first combat of Fantasy High. This clearly and obviously felt different. Let me kick it over to you guys. And I wanna start first and foremost with Zac because as much as we've all played so much D&D together, we've worked so much together. The feelings are real and we all knew I think everyone we did a lot of work grounding each other, being emotionally available for each other. Knowing that the season was a high lethality season. We've all watched the Game of Thrones. We kind of knew the drill but it's very different when it's actually happening both especially for the person that's happening for and then even for the other people that have to deal with a member of their party going through that. Zac, I will kick it over to you? What was this episode like? You can walk us through it from the beginning to end or just dive into like, your feelings about Lapin's death and the things preceding it in this episode. \n",
      "Zac: So from beginning to end, okay go on. Guys, there's like a million things you could talk about I feel like, just I was thinking about this point earlier today but it is very funny to like, in deciding to do a Game of Thrones Candyland campaign like obviously that's just sounds really fun. And like it sounds really silly and hilarious but once you're in it, and like once like you're in an episode where you die or whatever. That sucks and then like comedy is like gone, it's just like, it feels really shitty, but it also feels like part of like, yeah, I guess I did sign up for this. And yeah, there's just like, look rewatching that fight this is the first time we've watched them. I mean, I haven't seen anything prior to this. It's so wild how I literally only had one turn. I die by one hit point. \n",
      "Siobhan: And in one hit as well, he hits you once. \n",
      "Zac: Sorry, three hits. \n",
      "Brennan: Three attacks. \n",
      "Siobhan: But like one time. \n",
      "Brennan: One time, yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: It's one person its not like a bunch of people kill you It's just like bing beng bong. \n",
      "Zac: It's crazy, yeah. \n",
      "Brennan: Well, first of all, let's say something that is not only narratively true about this episode. But let's say something that in this instance, is mechanically true. And I think for all of us that have played as much D&D, as we've played, you begin to understand that for us, we're a seven person table. The dice are the eighth person at the table. And they're kind of your most cantankerous collaborator, because they're mindless. They don't necessarily... they're just there to represent randomness, right? And that can make things feel especially unfair. But that's kind of what they're there to do, to be arbitrary, Right? \n",
      "Ally: Two nat ones. \n",
      "Brennan: Two nat ones... \n",
      "Ally: On Siobhan’s roll, right like that's yeah, \n",
      "Brennan: What are the odds? \n",
      "Ally: I screamed \n",
      "Brennan: All it would have taken was Keradin was not rolling with advantage if he'd hit a not one on any of those three attack rolls. Lapin could have made it but we won't have this on mechanical level. And as a result of that on a narrative level Lapin, absolutely saved everyone's life in the one turn that will Lapin took. He got in between Keradin and Liam. Liam was that I think at that point eight hit points or something like that. So single digits casts fly on Theobald, right? That gets Ruby, Liam and Theobald up to the balcony. And it is only through Jet and Ruby that Amethar gets saved because without Ruby's, mage-handed rope and Jet's maneuvering attack, Amethar goes down. Absolutely every time, right. \n",
      "Zac: And I'm pretty great, now, I was watching this and I just have to admit this because like sometimes I feel like people give you credit for things you didn't even think of fully forgotten Theo has action search. That wasn't a plan on my part. I was like yeah, I don't know how I get him up there. And so that worked out really well but.\n",
      "Emily: But now you'll know next time \n",
      "Lou: Yeah. \n",
      "Emily: Oh no I didn't mean it in this context I meant in the next time that you play D&D I am not trying to be, \n",
      "Siobhan: The Elditch Knight who needs to fly \n",
      "Ally: Wow, rub it in. \n",
      "Zac: I just thought he was too heavy to pick up. And then well, just another side note is like if I had one more turn, I 100% would have lived. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. And I think Zac what you're referring to it's even more heartbreaking that we can share with us behind the scenes thing is that Lapin had a thunder step. \n",
      "Zac: I had thunder step which meant, this is bad if you wanna hear it. Very sad. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. \n",
      "Zac: If I rolled a net 20 on one of those death saves, I could have scooped Preston up and thunder stepped out of the church entirely. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. \n",
      "Ally: God damn it. \n",
      "Zac: It's just so sad. But also the other thing that I just gonna unload 'cause I just like, this happened in August and I've wanted to talk about it since the other thing was like you get eldritch invocations right as a warlock. I chose between two things and the one thing I didn't take was the thing as a reaction, I could basically take a ton of damage. And so I chose the other thing that led me if I was still be invisible. And so because I thought we probably have to run away from something. So if I chose another thing I'd be alive too. Yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: It made complete sense for Lapin that he would want to be invisible when he stayed still. \n",
      "Zac: For sure. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: You idiot, you fucking moron. \n",
      "Brennan: Well, it's a horrifying thing. And I find myself like going back through and like watching the episode again, looking at all these minor choices that lead up to certain like inescapable things like every one of these microscopic choices adds up to this thing that becomes unavoidable. Let's talk for a second too, because again, there's very little that I'm doing in these moments to steer the story. If you'd asked me at the beginning of this combat if I thought Lapin had the highest chances of being the one to die, never in a million years, never a million years. But Lapin's choice was incredibly heroic. He literally puts a paw on Liam's chest pushes him back and gets in between him and Keridan and it's one of those things where, the dice are happy to tell a Game of Thrones style story. They are happy to go Oh, you've done something heroic. You're primary spellcaster with the lowest hitpoints of the party and one of the lower armor classes. Great, we'll let that resolve mechanically. \n",
      "Zac: Yeah, happy to be cantankerous Brennan. \n",
      "Murph: I think it's beautiful too that Lapin went down the way that he did because it's like besides just like, the randomness of dice, but just the way the battlefield is where Lapin goes in the initiative. It's like, I don't know if you were to think about this episode. If you're like, somebody is gonna stay behind and have to sacrifice themselves. The most, like the quickest thing would be like, Oh, it's gonna be Amethar, or it's gonna be Theo being like a bodyguard or something. But the fact that it's when as soon as like the idea of Lapin goes in there, you're like, of course it has to be Lapin. He has to be the one it's like this kind of like shady character who people didn't know if they could trust and then it's like, no, he's the best, he's the good guy. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, he really is, it is this incredible moment of a insight into this guy that has been so inscrutable up into this moment doing this incredibly heroic thing. It also I think is, with the exception of if like one of the very sweet kids of the younger three party members had died. There is something about the idea of the heretic dying in the church... \n",
      "Zac: Very Game of Thrones (laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: Very Game of Thrones, the heretic dying in the church. And I think what one of the twins says at one point, like our healer, and so it's this idea, especially after where is your bulb now? It's like, hey here's the guy that got us out of our biggest jam and solved the mystery instantaneously, the guy who can magically bring us back when we drop, the guy who knew his way around all these politics the most. He's gone and now we're all running covered in blood through the streets of Canada. \n",
      "Emily: He was also the guy who led us there. Like knowing that he was gonna make sure we didn't get fucked over for it. \n",
      "Zac: Yeah oh, that makes me think of another thing that I feel uncomfortable saying after the fact. Because the situation changed so much. My plan changed so much. Can I tell you what I was going to do had things been different? \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, go for it. If this is an alternate timeline. \n",
      "Zac: Yeah, this is like commenting on last week. The end of the episode is we find out all that stuff about Amethar and his... if that had not happened, I think I was going to make a speech about being like the bad guy and not blame the family and take Liam and thunder step out. \n",
      "Brennan: Wow. \n",
      "Zac: But it didn't. There is too much other stuff going on. \n",
      "Ally: Oh. \n",
      "Zac: But that plan got fucked\n",
      "Brennan: Wow. \n",
      "Ally: That would have been so cool. \n",
      "Brennan: Well, that is the deal with initiative like there is, like the fact that Lapin what goes after Keradin ends up being this it's just all down to these numerical these things of the dice which reflects that lack of control that we feel in real life and all these things are outside of your control. That's so incredible. Actually, I want you to do another topic related to this, because, it becomes like Zac as Lapin goes down, and when he goes down, it's strands of Ruby, Jet, Liam and Theo up on the balcony because that fly spell loses concentration. I want to talk as well about something that happened in this fight which is Amethar I wanted a little bit Lou about something that we kind of vibe with in this episode, which is, it seemed at times like Amethar was very willing to be the last one standing in the cathedral \n",
      "Lou: Oh willing? You mean wanted. \n",
      "Emily: You were actively trying. I as your daughter was like no, I know that you're trying to get yourself killed right now and I need to make sure that this doesn't happen. \n",
      "Lou: I was so ready to die \n",
      "Emily: I was literally studying on maneuvering attack for the entire fucking fight just waiting for you to have movement. \n",
      "Lou: It was maddening because I was like I don't know, yeah, I like came into this episode and immediately it's funny to watch myself truly be so upset. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Like Emily has all those like fun lines that you are throwing at me with like I throw you up into the like the balcony, you're like I'm gonna find a way to come back down. And I remember in that moment nothing has ever made me more upset during a game, \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "the idea that you would come back down after a nat 20, the fact that got you up there. I was like, oh, thank God. But I was just so upset and scared that anyone or more specifically that Ruby or Jet would die in this situation. But yeah, I was ready to die. I mean, if you had, it's funny, like when I asked you that question of like, do they need more time to get away? I'm hoping you'll tell me that I can jump back in and die for that. I'm hoping you'll give me a reason to not go further in this campaign. \n",
      "Emily: It was really, really frustrating. I was so worried, I was just like, my dad is trying to kill himself right now my dad is trying to kill himself. \n",
      "Lou: 100%, 100%. It was annoying. It was like when you put the when I realized you guys couldn't get out without somebody breaking those doors for you. I was like I don't know, it was like that was hard because I live with people and now I have to figure out how to get up there to get them out of here. It was a lot. \n",
      "Ally: It was a mix. It was a mix too. Because you were so in character just trying to go after the Pontifex. And I was like, I guess if Lou dies that way. It makes sense in game but then when she just like, healed herself, twice, like massively I was like, Oh, he's gotta get the fuck out of here like. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, I don't wanna say this to rub salt in the wound I truly don't but if memory serves the Pontifex was less than 20 damage away from dead\n",
      "Lou: Yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: I think I also fucked up with that I don't think I could have killed her fully but I think she did take a movement that I forgot to do my grasping arrow damage on, but it's that it's still only Max 12 damage, it wouldn't have killed her. \n",
      "Brennan: No but it's this horrifying, and so the beard eponymous was very close to dead. But again, that's the kind of thing where like, even if you guys had managed to kill the Pontifex in that battle, which would have had big global ramifications, you still would have had that whole church full. And it wasn't like Pontifex was the biggest I don't think she even swings on you guys. It's but... \n",
      "Lou: She prays a lot. \n",
      "Brennan: Just prays a lot. \n",
      "Ally: Well would that have changed politically, that our like status has been completely against them. \n",
      "Brennan: I can't imagine in that moment that killing the head of the church would have done you guys a lot of political favors. \n",
      "Ally: Checks out. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: But obviously we can't get into too much about would haves because there's stuff that happens later in the season that we can't get into. But point being what's so fascinating about Amethar wanting to have that last stand there is a lot of times it's so fascinating what the effect mechanics have on storytelling, because I realized there were two ways for you guys to get out of the church, right? The windows that were nearly impossible to break, or the doors that had the entire Imperial Army coming in between you guys, right? Those are the two options right? So, in this battle, it becomes clear that you guys are like, okay, we're gonna try to go for the windows option. And I can tell Lou that you suddenly realize that the only person in the party who can routinely clear 20 points of damage in a single attack is Amethar. \n",
      "Lou: I think Liam was literally or Ally was literally talking in there like the max I can do is like 17 \n",
      "Ally: Yeah\n",
      "Brennan: I just wanna say this was not a secret fuck you, to prevent Amethar from having his glorious last stand. And the reason being is your boy thought Amethar would probably be dead already by this point. So the fact that Amethar was even in this fight is something like when you realize that mechanic element is that we did like what I guess Amethar was going through a thing similar to what Lou was going through where it's like, instead of me being able to sacrifice myself to buy them time, I suddenly can tell they can't bust through that window, or it's very unlikely that they will without. \n",
      "Lou: Yeah, I think that was like and then I think right around that time is when I think the chain of events starts that is like, Ruby throws down the rope in the fog cloud. And then Jet uses the maneuvering attack and it's like, okay, this is what's supposed to happen. Not what I thought or what I wanted to happen. \n",
      "Ally: Those were such clutch moves, I'm just like rewatching this today, I was like \n",
      "Lou: It plays out so cool of like, the rope down, the maneuvering attack up and then... \n",
      "Ally: No, no, like opportunity attacks from that like crowd of people. \n",
      "Zac: That made me feel like in that moment I was like, it would be cool. I wanna play a Battle Master. I've never played that and I was like, oh, I didn't know you did that I thought he's just 100% dead. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "No way. \n",
      "Brennan: It’s actually a super… I mean, I love Jet and Amethar's relationship because they're so similar and they are so, in that fight so antagonistic to each other. Where Amethar... \n",
      "Emily: Because she’s just trying to be exactly like him. \n",
      "(laughing) \n",
      "Murph: They both have no self preservation \n",
      "Lou: And it's infuriating to see. \n",
      "Brennan: It's like dude, its like putting magnets the wrong way against each other. Where it's like no, I'm gonna die for you. No, I'm gonna die for you. But it's funny because, \n",
      "Emily: It's also like, I'm the mirror that's reflected everything you've passively taught me for my entire life. \n",
      "Lou: I think that's what I realized watching this episode. I think in the moment I was just mad at you. I was just angry. Oh yeah I was like \n",
      "Emily: You mean Lou was mad at Emily \n",
      "Lou: No. Me as Amethar was just too deep in character. \n",
      "Siobhan: We were all mad about you and we're texting behind your back \n",
      "Lou: It was just like me, Amethar being mad at the moves that Ruby was making because I was like, please like the idea of either you or Jet dying in this fight was too much for me like what it was... \n",
      "Ally: It was just insane to rewatch this everybody's vibe is so kind of like giggly and fun and scared and like dropping shit and then Lou, like I feel like you were the most still person ever for your first, you were like, all right, \n",
      "Lou: The whole time my mouth is like here infront of my mouth. Yeah, it's crazy to watch it now because it is so clear that you're just being like Amether, and it's incredible to watch it like it makes for an amazing episode. \n",
      "Murph: I truly love it whenever the mechanic of D&D leads to great story moments like that, like the twins coming together to save Amethar and also like it all checks out like look at the book y'all \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah it so... \n",
      "Murph: Like this is what would happen in Lord of the Rings and they did it with... \n",
      "Brennan: They did it, it's fucking incredible and there's an amazing thing too of like the, exactly the mechanics go for it and it's just such a great mirroring thing of Amethar’s nat 20 yeeting of his daughter to the balcony that nat 20 and then Jet kind of being like fuck you I save your life and and this beautiful use of maneuvering attack that you can see or hear the fog cloud, Amethar just disappears and they don't know where he goes. \n",
      "Lou: Masterful, good masterful \n",
      "Brennan: And then that thing I couldn't believe it was too poetic because I was like, I was right through to my head, I knew that I made the battle so hard. And it was like I said the Nat 20 is what's needed with an athletics check. And then I'm like, but Amethar has done more than half of the damage to like, weaken the stone structure. So fuck, I'll say 19 and they're not gonna roll a 19 and then Theobald hits the 19. It fucking goes out of the window \n",
      "Lou: Damn dude \n",
      "Zac: I mean its just beautiful to see Murph get a high number \n",
      "Murph: You absolutely couldn't \n",
      "Lou: Cause you eat it earlier in the episode like a couple times, like a couple of classic rough rolls at the time. \n",
      "Murph: I’ve been eating it for three years baby. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: Truly, truly incredible. Well it's a beautiful haunting episode. I'll say one other behind the scenes thing too, in terms of what Ally was saying about like, the stillness of that episode, which was the episode came out to be like an hour 50 or something like that. We shot I think for two and a half hours. And our beautiful, wonderful editors who made the incredible choice to like leave a lot of the episode unscored. So there's like not music underneath everything. Because I remember one of the things edited out is the first round of combat. There were long minute to two-minute long silences. When it got to any people's turns of them just like looking. \n",
      "Siobhan: Oh yeah it was like truly playing chess against a grandmaster and you might die if you lose. \n",
      "Ally: I think it was all of us realizing like this is a total party kill. And just doing that math and being like, can we do it? \n",
      "Siobhan: Right, especially once the first couple of people get hit and they take like half or more of the hit points in one hit. Like I went into this combat like, okay I think we can do this it will be hard but like all we have to do is get out. That book seems cool pretty fun if I steal that book on the way out gotta get that book that's gotta be the thing that I do that's what I'm focused on and that immediately 'cause I was pretty far down the initiative order people took damage I was like, oh my God. (laughs) \n",
      "Zac: Then it becomes, Can we crawl out of the window. \n",
      "Siobhan: How skinny can I make myself, I’m so tiny\n",
      "Murph: I’m just a little rat I just want to scurry out, can I just scurry away\n",
      "Zac: I’ll be so tiny \n",
      "Murph: I'll leave everyone, I'll leave Lapin. \n",
      "Ally: I'm sorry. \n",
      "Brennan: Oh God, well that's the funny thing about this episode too is there's like a yeah, it quickly becomes an escape thing. It also made me realize that like let's say Amethar wasn't like in this episode that had died previously. Total party killers, right but this could very readily become a total party. I think I said one minor thing about like the kids could have maybe squeezed out of the windows and I would have maybe made that like a DC 20 like acrobatics check. So going into this episode or in the planning of it, there was a part of me that's like if they don't fight their way through the guards to the door. There's a real possibility that four out of six PCs die. And it's just Ruby and Jet escaping because of their high acrobatics scores. \n",
      "Emily: I wouldn't have escaped. I just wouldn't have. \n",
      "Siobhan: I think I would have made you. \n",
      "Emily: I guess Ruby could have talked me into it, but I probably would have tried to follow my dad and Theo's footsteps. \n",
      "Ally: And it was so lethal that one one moment of second guessing could have killed you. If it took a round to convince you, \n",
      "Siobhan: Right, especially with those like Emily and I both did rounds where we did more than 20 damage but it's because we had once a day effects that we used. \n",
      "Ally: Right? \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah absolutely. \n",
      "Siobhan: We would have been able to use those against the window if we hadn't already used them. \n",
      "Ally: Could you have fainted on to the window. \n",
      "Emily: If I had used a superiority die. I don't remember what like this was in August. I don't remember what my abilities were. But if I had used a superiority die, that would have gotten me a high in it. Like if I rolled fucking awesome, then I maybe could have hit it. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, if you had done some kind of superiority die and quit you could have gotten like 4 D8 plus your Dex which would have gotten you to where you need to be. But all of that is like, so intense to think about managing your resources in that way. I'm sure we'll come back to this topic a lot. But just before we move into audience questions, I do wanna get started on those. For everyone else, we heard from Zac at the beginning about going through PC death for other people at the table. What was that like? And when did you realize like oh, this is probably going to, we're not all gonna make it out of here. \n",
      "Murph: I think as soon as Keradin got his attacks in, it was like, oh, we need to go. And then I think you go through the thing in your head where like at first you're playing Warhammer, right? And you're looking at the board, you're just like, Okay, I have this many spaces. We could do this, like, this is how we get to Lapin or whatever. And then it almost becomes so impossible that then you go back to roleplay. And you're like, if the castle at Winterfell is being stormed and you see your friend gets stabbed at the front, but your whole family is here and you got to bash them through. You got to just bash the door and get everybody get as many people through as you can. And it becomes roleplay again. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah \n",
      "Murph: In a weird way. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah. \n",
      "Emily: I think because I was playing someone because I pretty much as soon as Amethar threw me I knew he was going to try and get himself killed. I kind of just like, I couldn't really get out of the character to be like, ah, yes, we must make sure everyone survives. I went in fully into get Amethar out of heeo mode. So I feel like that was pretty much the only thing I thought about the whole fight \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Murph: I think that's how a child should be at that situation. \n",
      "Emily: Yeah, unfortunately yeah. \n",
      "Zac: I also think that's why he's alive. \n",
      "Lou: Yeah, totally 100%. \n",
      "Emily: Yeah I'm saying in terms of PC death, like maybe I could there was even it was like really tragic. But it was also like, I almost just lost Amethar as well. Holyshit. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yeah, it was definitely a somewhat callous choice to leave Lapin in favor of Amethar. \n",
      "Emily: Yes. \n",
      "Zac: Well, I'm just some weird guy still I think... \n",
      "Emily: I would have absolutely thrown you a maneuver attack as well but you went down. \n",
      "Murph: But yeah, look it was down so that's \n",
      "Siobhan: Right, none of us has any healing spells \n",
      "Murph: As soon as Lapin was down, he was dead pretty much. \n",
      "Siobhan: Right? \n",
      "Ally: Yeah, because exactly fly was over. I remember... \n",
      "Siobhan: Fly was over and we were already away. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: There was nobody down there. \n",
      "Murph: The only other option was, what Amethar was talking about is like, I don't know you see somebody down and you're like well would my character just leave this person behind? Am I going to die as a matter of principle and you have to make that decision we're just like, no, that doesn't totally make sense 'cause you got all these other people that you're supposed to be helping and everything but that that was like the big choice for me. I was like, just does Theo just go like Alright, I'm gonna try to get Lapin out as a matter of principle, but \n",
      "Lou: Yeah. \n",
      "Emily: Theo I would have freaked out. I mean, no. \n",
      "Murph: I think honestly it was because of the way Amethar was so ready to sacrifice himself that I was like, the relationship that Theo and Amethar have. I think this fundamentally changes the character that I thought Theo was because I was like, now I think Theo isn't the guy that sacrifices himself. I think he feels that like Sir Davos who's like, we need to do the smart, let's get out, we need to go like he gave his life so like now, let's make it worth it. You know what I mean? \n",
      "Brennan: That's a pretty cool thing, that feels like I mean, it's such a cool thing to watch Theo and Lapin's relationship in Episode one, they fully hate each other. And there's I mean, literally the last exchange that you have is Theo saying, \"I underestimated your Chancellor\" and Lapin saying, \"Oh, shut up\", and it's so beautiful. \n",
      "Lou: It’s so beautiful. It is most beautiful Thing. \n",
      "Brennan: And I think Theo is the dude who I think Theo has the ability to be the like, at this point in the campaign and Theo definitely could be like, I'm gonna stay here and die so that you all can live. But there's something beautiful actually, about him and Lapin sort of passing in the night of being like I'm gonna die heroically even though I'm the stuffy curled lip old like mastermind, and you're gonna be smart and prudent and get the job done even though you're the big armored knight. And that's like, so beautiful that the influence of those two characters on each other. God I love this fucking... \n",
      "(Siobhan soft cries) (laughs) \n",
      "Ally: Yeah I remember feeling kind of guilty because I think Lapin and Liam were the two kind of weirdo outsiders of the party, like Theo is at least pretty normal. And so yeah, just in doing like mechanics when it was all going down, I was thinking like, okay, if I get stuck here or I go down, it will be like royalty first and maybe because I'm a kid, someone will be like, oh, shoot, we really have to get Liam. But then when Lapin stepped in and was like making plans for me to like, get out of there \n",
      "Siobhan: Well you're more royal than any of us. \n",
      "Emily: That's true. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, at the start of the battle, it's Prince Liam of Candia. \n",
      "Emily: I still feel as though the church would have come after Liam. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: Oh, for sure. \n",
      "Zac: I think they were saying that \n",
      "Emily: In that scene it definitely felt like they're coming after Amethar. But Liam is also still fucked. \n",
      "Zac: Because his dad's in open rebellion or whatever. \n",
      "Brennan: Yes exactly. \n",
      "Ally: But I do think it was like just very potent survivor's guilt that had me send Preston down like, oh, you have an advantage on something. \n",
      "Zac: I probably was very close to crying in that moment. \n",
      "Ally: Oh God, I mean 'cause you were like yeah, you were a stuffy old person but you had just become so important to the party. So it felt insane. \n",
      "Emily: I thought that it was so sweet. That you sent it, I thought that was really nice. \n",
      "Ally: And then when Ruby tackled me out of the window, when we were all leaving I was really on defense. \n",
      "Siobhan: That wasn’t me, that was Jet. \n",
      "Ally: Oh, that was Jet. Oh, sorry, when Jet tackled me out of the window. oh yeah, 'cause you took my phone. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "I was like, oh, shoot. Yeah, the choice is out of my hands. \n",
      "Brennan: I will take a moment to say R.I.P to Peppermint Preston. \n",
      "Ally: I know \n",
      "Brennan: The Peppermint Pig. \n",
      "Siobhan: You’re a murderer he did nothing wrong. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Attacked once in his whole life. \n",
      "Lou: Its a big move \n",
      "Ally: (Holding a candle)  Peppermint Preston was a good guy and... \n",
      "Brennan: No. \n",
      "Ally: He was my only friend but... \n",
      "Brennan: I'm gonna say... \n",
      "Emily: I would watch like seven hours of Liam stuttering to express himself. \n",
      "Ally: Liam trying to do a eulogy. Does everyone hate me? \n",
      "(hysterical laugh) \n",
      "Brennan: I will say right now that I felt truly it's so funny I being in a situation and being like well here's the kind of like, this is the ambush. This is the murder attempt. There's priests with crossbows in the rafters like where they are here to capture or if not capture, kill the House of Rocks. And I feel so wrong because earlier in the episode I gave that speech to you Ally about like, \"Hey, I don't want anything bad to happen \"to Peppermint Preston.\" but just know that Peppermint Preston reflects like half of your class features. So it's that thing of and it's really funny because people are like don't kill the dog and you're like, okay don't bring the dog to a fight because ultimately like Preston has a set of abilities is what makes Liam as a Beast Master Ranger competent and good in a fight. If you want Preston to run away and hide Preston will survive but you will be punching so far under weight. \n",
      "Ally: I mean, Preston was completely safe. I mean like you're about to leave, and I just was like God I have to send something and maybe I did something \n",
      "Emily: It was beautiful. \n",
      "Brennan: It was beautiful, it was absolutely beautiful and it was heartbreaking for me too because I'll be super honest with you. Preston went down there right before Keradin's turn. And Lapin is already down with a death saving for a failure. And in terms of Keradin is not just gonna stand there. So Peppermint Preston's death is what enabled Lapin to have another chance at a death saving throw. Like it was a heartbreaking decision of like, oh god, it's like a pig and well, if Keradin attacks Preston, then at least Lapin has another shot at... \n",
      "Ally: Yeah imagine if I sent Preston down there and you just absolutely obliterate Lapin and I'm like well Preston come back. \n",
      "(hysterical laugh) \n",
      "Emily: Grab anything from his pockets while you're there Preston? \n",
      "Murph: Well Keradin is gonna go for Lapin because he's prone. \n",
      "(loud laughs) \n",
      "And that’s a automatic crit because he’s there. That's two death saving fails. Lapin is dead. \n",
      "Zac: Great weapon master on his body. \n",
      "Murph: Second attack, he’s going to great weapon master on Peppermint Preston \n",
      "Brennan: also we’ll talk for a second about the heartbreaking Lapin's vision, by the way, I need to say something here as well about Peppermint Preston because I've seen some people online saying already. There are home rules in this campaign that prevent certain like, Liam was not allowed to take healing spells. There is no revivification or resurrection in this world. It's a highly lethal world. That lack of revivification also extends to animal companions and familiars. So, that is a heartbreaking element to this world as well, \n",
      "Ally: I feel like I knew that in the moment and was just like, \"Oh fuck\" but there was a small part of me that was like, well he is familiar. \n",
      "Zac: Well thank you, thank you for trying to give me another last chance \n",
      "Emily: I though it was beautiful. \n",
      "Brennan: It was beautiful. \n",
      "Zac: That was very nice. \n",

      "Brennan: Doing this season not live and seeing fan reactions is a curse (laughs). We know everything that's coming and you're just there gripping the edge of your seat. I wanna talk about Lapin's beautiful visions in this episode the nat 20 check for the... Actually I think we have a question about this as well. This was from, we'll start doing some questions from Elizabeth Ryder, thanks Elizabeth. \n",
      "“Zac rolled that nat 20 on the book and Brennan promised that he would get more insight of the nature of the bulb later. When is later? if you can't answer what's everyone's favorite Beardsley pop culture reference?” \n",

      "Zac: It's always like a really like flavorful, like a kind of like refreshing sounding drink a lot of times. \n",

      "(laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: I love that so much \n",
      "Ally: Oh my God. \n",
      "Brennan: So talking about the visions for Lapin, in this heartbreaking moment of kind of, I guess you might call it dramatic irony that Lapin has this deep vision and insight into the nature of reality moments before his murder and that vision of number one that, this kind of like gray delineated scale of like, the Bulb is real, it does exist, it's magic can be accessed. But it may be more powerful than the Sugar Plum Fairy but it's of the same material so it's not of the same type, like it's not. In other words, it is not the one true faith. The things that Bulbians say about the bulb where it is the sole creator and everything else is any, other magical thing is heresy of the hungry one is not true. And then the second revelation being that the Bulb is mindless that it doesn't choose champions. It is not sentient or sapient. And that people that access it's magic, maybe they have a relationship with a vision of the Bulb but that doesn't mean that the Bulb has that relationship with them. Which led to Lapin's super sick line there at the end, of the Bulb does not care for you just a wild thing to spit in the face of the zealots that are about to murder you. \n",
      "Zac: Yeah it's such a like, kind of dense topic to have a revelation about 12 seconds before you die. \n",
      "Ally: I mean, you did DMT was Cadbury on the spirt molecule \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, I love that, we see that and it's also heartbreaking lines that you say of like my third wish like, and I think that that's the thing about D&D where you're living a story, but it's a story with random chance in it which stories don't have in our real world, right? Real life has random chance but stories don't in a story the hero just seems like they're in danger. The storyteller knows that they're gonna make it through to the end. There's a heartbreaking exchange where you're like, I never gave the Sugar Plum Fairy her third wish. I'm like, in other words, like, I'm not supposed to die. \n",
      "Zac: I'm not done yet, yeah, it's sad. It's weird though. Yeah, Like in that moment of I think I saw some people in the comment, in a YouTube chat that were like, what about praying to the Sugar PLum Fairy right now while you're unconscious or whatever. It's like yeah, I guess I'll try but like, does that mechanically mean anything at all? Not really. \n",
      "Brennan: Right? I mean, like, not to be this way.\n",
      "(Laughing at something of camera) \n",
      "Siobhan are you good? \n",
      "Ally: Make a noise. \n",
      "Emily: Make a noise, please make a noise. \n",

      "Siobhan: My children are so embarrassing. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah \n",
      "Emily: Just like \n",
      "Brennan: The cats attacking the Denny’s sign we love to see it but yeah the idea of like I'm not done yet the thing is that like praying to the Sugar Plum Fairy or whatever that is represented on your character sheet by the incredible supernatural abilities that Lapin has like that's what those are for which is I think is important. I think in other genres as well we would play more fast and loose with like let me pull some shit out of my ass and it's like sure go for it but this one this is like the consequences season and it was a extremely noble and heroic sacrifice that was made and again that the Rock's family did not stand a chance without that fly spell. \n",
      "Ally: I think each of us had our I was about to say biggest carrot dangling and mine was literally a carrot. But like just the person we hated most was in that fight to tempt us to stay and try to like, brawl it out. \n",
      "Emily: I believe you call them a carrot dildo at one point. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Ally: Oh my god. \n",
      "Emily: I don't think that counts as a pop culture reference, but \n",

      "Siobhan: The carrot dildo just to keep you on track. \n",
      "Brennan: Oh to keep me on track. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yeah, to keep you on track that's what we are talking about. \n",
      "Brennan: Gotya, thank you so much for keeping me on track. Yeah. Well, I will say, part of the encounter design of this one there was a mean element to this combat and, \n",
      "Zac: How so?\n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Brennan: And by mean, I don't mean that it was unfair obviously the challenge rate there was no rule where you guys were gonna kill every single combatant who was in this place. But rather, I think the thing that was the most not necessarily intentionally but looking at the episode in hindsight, the most cruel about the encounter design here was you had enemies that you truly had reason to hate on a personal level in this fight, right? And they were there within striking distance of you like you could, Pontifex was 20 points of damage way if you guys are all focused fired on Keradin, you probably could have killed Keradin. But of course all of this is against a ticking clock and an action economy that you guys are so overwhelmingly at disadvantage for if everyone takes her around to drop Keradin, it goes from being one player character death to probably three or four and it's this horrifying it's almost like Aladdin with like the gem that Abu the monkey steals. It's like look at all these tantalizing enemies for you, you could definitely kill Plumbeline, right? Plumbeline’s is right here. She lied about who the Emperor was. Looking at hindsight there's almost war like traps in a way. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah exactly. \n",
      "Brennan: Of like this such limited action economy and such limited ability to like, that combat was less than three rounds. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah Grissini moving forward each turn was like a really great visual of like the walls closing in on us, kind of like you don't have time. \n",
      "Emily: Yeah. \n",
      "Brennan: 1.000.000% we're gonna jump to some questions now. This one's from Hold on. Oh, this one's from Rain Solo. Thanks Rain Solo and thanks for modding. By the way, big shout out to all our wonderful mods in the chat. Yay for mods. \n",
      "(cheerful clapping) \n",

      "\"Hey everyone after nesting the episode, can we talk about the impact of having no preview this week and just that cut to black. So far my feelings would be summarized as one, what an incredible choice and two, Ow!”\n",
      "Incredible choice on the part of our editors. And also to say that like it just didn't feel right to jump into the next time on after our first full PC death yeah watching the episode it is very it's final it's very final in a way. And I misspoke earlier we have had other PC permadeaths before like, spoilers for Unsleeping City but Kugrash at the end of the Unsleeping City makes a tremendous sacrifice but that was so in Murph's hands to do that. And it was the final episode. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah that was like the end of the character act too. \n",
      "Emily: Kugrash isn’t dead you can't convince me of it. \n",
      "Siobhan: Kugrash could also come back, he didn’t die he joins the universe. \n",
      "Brennan: Ah, yeah he becomes a bodhisattva, he becomes a enlightened bagel entity and he's a filthy numinous spirit at one with all the trash of the cosmos, It's just beautiful. \n",
      "Zac: Wow. \n",
      "Brennan: Wow. But I think the impact of like, this is a different kind of permadeath. This is like the dice are taking someone's character and they're taking it away from them and now something different has to happen. And it just was felt crazy to be like, Lapin's death, The House of Rock fleeing through the streets and then like next time on. \n",
      "(funny bleep sounds ) \n",
      "You're telling me we gonna or whatever the next time outside will be \n",

      "“hey y'all hope you're staying safe. So you know you need to tell us about whatever the vote is now, right? You know now that Zoom messages show up, right? We demand to know or we'll be forced to shake the info out of y'all at Denny's thanks.” \n",
      "So last week we a little bit came up with a vote before the season that was taken. I promise you will not forget about this. It actually does contain spoilers. So we can’t divulge but at the end of the season, we will tell you about the vote we took. \n",
      "Lou: How exciting for all of you to have this anticipatory thing to get to hold it in your hearts... \n",
      "Siobhan: Definitely worth it to wait another 10 weeks for this information? \n",
      "Lou: Exactly the truth of the vote will come out in June \n",
      "Zac: And you'll probably be like, Oh. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Murph: If this is what I think it is, \n",
      "Emily: Yeah, it is what you think it is Murph\n",
      "Murph: And so if people hear the question they'll know who voted what? \n",
      "Siobhan: Right. \n",
      "Brennan: Absolutely. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah, I remember we all predicted that, I remember as soon as that happened we were like, yeah. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, exactly that's funny I loved it. Here comes another one here? Oh, this is from Soaf. \n",
      "“What were Lapin's other wishes from the Sugar Plum Fairy.” \n",
      "Thanks Soaf. Zac, this is a long time ago in memory but I believe that the first two wishes, wish one was for Lapin to become a member of the Bulbian church. And the second one was \n",
      "Zac: I thought... \n",
      "Brennan: To become Chaplain of Castle Candy and become a like a tutor and aide to the Rock's family. \n",
      "Zac: Yes, I mean, it was in August I don't fully remember what it was. I think it had to do with those and like maybe having to do with the actual powers I had. But at least had to do with those statuses and like getting to where he could be a like mover and shaker in the world. \n",
      "Brennan: Yes, but I remember the funny thing is that the wishes were for things you had to devout your life to doing to serve the Sugar Plum Fairy and your magical abilities were something that the Sugar Plum Fairy gave you to be able to do those tasks more easily. \n",
      "Zac: That's right, that makes more sense, yeah. \n",
      "Brennan: Where it was a reversal of the thing of like, it was a reversal of like the Genie and Aladdin relationship of the spirit was asking three wishes of the mortal and giving you magic in order to do those tasks better. \n",
      "Zac: That's apparently not enough magic. \n",
      "(all exclaiming) \n",
      "Murph: Very good. \n",
      "Brennan: Yes. \n",
      "Zac: I guess I don’t know. \n",

      "“Question for all the players, did seeing a full player death occur change your approach to playing at all, obviously characters will be changed by the death but did you feel yourself actually play any differently after witnessing a PC die? Also shout out to the amazing editors who made an already dreadful episode somehow even more terrifying” \n",
      "hell yes. So I don't wanna get into spoiler territory here. So without getting too specific \n",
      "Siobhan: I wouldn't say Lapin's death, specifically, but just this combat in general made me play more seriously not that I wasn't taking it seriously before then, but really like trying to play to the top of my intelligence as much as possible and try and look at every single one of my things that I could do, to like, in combination work creatively around the board, Rick Perry for this season, very helpfully printed us out sheets every time we leveled up with all of our abilities on them. Which was super, super helpful. Just to see it in front of you instead of like whatever it is that I scribbled margin \n",
      "Ally: That I scribbled in the margin, yeah. \n",
      "Siobhan: Right, exactly. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah, I think it was also, I mean, like in character we got to get more serious so it wasn't like an arbitrary like, oh God now me as Ally I'm thinking like, Oh, I have to be better at this even Liam would be like, holy shit that was a nightmare like focus. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah, I think I spoke on this a little bit before but I do think this kind of shifted the mood at the table where I think when you think PC death or something you think them dying against like, the big bad evil guy at the end or something or like spoilers from Unsleeping City or you think of Kugrash dying, but that's like the end of their story. So when you go into this in the back of my head I'm kind of thinking like, oh, Amethar will die in some very poetic way that's like, he will be assassinated. That will be the clean cut like story moments, we will get revenge in this way or something. But then when it's like, once Lapin dies, that it's like, oh, this is truly just whoever's in trouble is actually in trouble. We can't just like do the heroic thing and assume that you're fine because you're a main character, you know what I mean? \n",
      "Ally: Yeah, I think the first interaction where everyone was just going for Amethar no matter what, I thought that was maybe gonna happen and then it was not the case (laughs), \n",
      "Murph: Yeah weirdly Amethar surviving kind of makes the deaths feel more real. Because it's like, that's the story one that's like supposed to happen. That's the one we're gunning for. And then once it doesn't happen, then it's like, oh, well, anyone could die I guess not just Amethar. \n",
      "Brennan: It never fails watching this season with fans and with you guys. It absolutely didn't occur to me at the time how much the game was Boosting the stuff we said was true about the story, because it's so wild to have this backstory for Amethar of a guy who's living like literally Amethar's first scene is him surrounded by giant statues of his heroic sisters. That's the first scene, it's like, \n",
      "Zac: And they're all dead. \n",
      "Brennan: They're all dead, like a complete visual metaphor for a person who loves these women more than anything and is doing his best to live in their shadow, like literal visual metaphor for you. And what's so crazy is you're like what are the odds that Amethar would have become the unfallen and then you look at these first three combats and you go like, \"pretty good.\" Amethar doesn't go down or if he does go down, he gets back up again. And watching that be something that's very cool mechanically and then also horrifying because I think it is especially in this episode Amethar, a big part of him wanted to make the sacrifice play and watching someone who kind of like is almost a curse like can't die and what's great is that D&D mechanics support that barbarians are hard to fucking kill. Lou did you feel like watching it again, that resonance of like the mechanics backing up like what we said was true about your backstory? \n",
      "Lou: Definitely, I mean I think this is like, especially this time it felt it was honestly tough. This was the first time it was like I was against it because of the headspace I was in. It was like, oh, wow, I'm a mother to kill. Like when all of those dudes are just like, surrounding me on the altar like stabbing up at me. And I know it like still only brings me down to 20 it's like wait there was still so much. It just yeah, it's tough to take me down \n",
      "Siobhan: You had two handfuls of dice, I think for that roll. \n",
      "Lou: And I think I still came out with 28 left. \n",
      "Brennan: Oh yeah, I did amounts of damage to Amethar in every one of these battles that would have dropped anybody else. \n",
      "Siobhan: Barbarians are good. \n",
      "Brennan: Barbarians are good. it's crazy and it's true of Theo as a character build as well. I hit Theo one time this battle, like it was a nat 20 so there's a lot of damage. But that's just the thing, it's like Theo is out here not getting hit. He's got an armor class of 21. Like, what are you gonna do? And it's a wild thing when you build- heads up to anyone playing D&D. If you make characters that are very good at not dying You will often watch your like party members go before you which is like we saw in this episode. \n",
      "Zac: I'll say that I'm dying completely changed how I play. \n",
      "(hysterical laughter) \n",
      "This character death completely changed it. \n",

      "Brennan: Oh, so cool. You gotta check that out when it comes out. \n",

      "Siobhan: Did you see him in... Is it all the money in the world? The one that he replaced Kevin Spacey? \n",
      "Brennan: Yes, yes, yes, \n",
      "Siobhan: Performance in that movie is fucking spectacular. And he's in it for a very short period of time. And it's maybe his best performance. He shot it in two days, because Kevin Spacey Got metoo-ed. \n",

      "Siobhan: You didn't buy any of it though. \n",
      "Murph: Then we went to the register and you had like $70 worth of just like things. \n",

      "Emily: We feed them twice a day but it was just a special meal because she gets really excited whenever we make boiled chickens. We bought some just for her and the kids. \n",
      "Murph: So we had a Mother's Day party with a bunch of cats outside. Because we’re insane\n",
      "(laughs) \n",

      "Ally: I don't think you can. \n",

      "Lou: part mock trial. (mumbles) \n",
      "Siobhan: All the male characters, I will say, well, like What's up, bro? I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I'm stupid and all the women were like you just have to do the thing. \n",
      "Brennan: It was that for 67 pages \n",
      "Siobhan: Why are you the boss? For 67 pages.\n",
      "Brennan: I will say this there's nothing that the stage is better equipped to handle in terms of storytelling. Then three and a half hours of bringing up and immediately solving logistical problems. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yes \n",
      "Brennan: And that ultimately is theater and. \n",
      "Siobhan: it's incredible to do an action space comedy that is also 90% jumbled exposition. \n",
      "Lou: Yes. \n",
      "Brennan: Wow. It's truly beautiful. \n",
      "Siobhan: These poor children having to learn like my Lord does the Zebulons are at war with the Nigerians, but the Nigerians are in space and they're not really cool the Nigerians I just couldn't think of another word and then the mining of the radiation which means that, the nightmare of learning lines is already so hard and to have to do that with just full nonsense. \n",
      "Brennan: But I will say this if you're looking for a play where the major plot issue hinges on the radiation half life of bones you are \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Emily: I am, that sounds great. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Siobhan: You would have loved it, it was directly during the NADDPOD finale. \n",
      "Brennan: Truly, truly wild. \n",
      "Zac: I made some steaks using my dad's recipe for steaks that I love even though I don't really eat steaks that often. And so that was like a kind of a nice, familiar thing that I don't often treat myself to and then use it to make some fried rice. The leftovers and that was also just sort of a nice treat as well. So a lot of food from, \n",
      "Ally: I've been wanting to try that recipe since you told it to me, and I still haven't. \n",
      "Zac: Give it up we'll talk later I got it. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Emily: I made some kombucha with some Scalia picked up from Lou with masks protected. \n",
      "Siobhan: Lou and I did a little exchange of he brought me some kombucha and I gave him some cold brew that I've been like spicing.. \n",
      "Lou: Incredible cold brew. Siobhan makes incredible spiced cold brew. It'll change how you feel about it cold brew. I stopped drinking coffee and now like, well, I got to start drinking coffee again. Siobhan's cold brew is too good too, say no to. (laughs) \n",
      "Siobhan: Thank you, I'm so happy to give you another bad habit. \n",
      "Lou: It's real it's a problem. You've cursed me. \n",

      "Ally: This little heroine pack. \n",
      "Murph: Give me one little M&M of heroine. \n",
      "Siobhan: It's time to step out of the money-based economy and it’s barter now and that's just how it is. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah. \n",
      "Lou: There you go. \n",
      "Brennan: I love that, I've been to a lot of happy little things, feel very fortunate life here with Ozzy and Metallica is very, very good. I read a thread that I have been quoting a lot to people as I've been talking, because in this weird, isolated time that we're all in, it's weird that I feel way more connected to a lot of people like I'm Facetiming more with my parents. I am I touch with people who otherwise I wouldn't have been in touch with. And I think that there's a lot of like, an unease this acute. We're like living through history, which is always so shocking. I feel like there's just a strange postmodern impulse that all ascribed to myself, having grown up as a little kid in the 90s. And now be this weird sense of like history that's from the 20th century. We're supposed to be done with events, like what do you mean things continue to happen forever and ever. And let me say something as sort of bizarre as this time and the unease you can feel. I read this one Twitter thread that impressed upon me and has given me lots of joy and happiness through perspective of like, basically said, like, through all of human history, the rule has been mayhem and death at the cause of diseases and plagues. And that's just the rule. That's just what happens is a new disease crops up, it spreads across the globe or it spreads wherever it spreads. And it's like, that's just the way things go, people talk about the Spanish flu. My grandma was talking to me about polio, and just the reality of that, like, yeah that's just like life that's in living memory and... \n",
      "Siobhan: Mitch Mconnel had polio. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, it's like. \n",
      "Ally: I mean, the AIDS crisis was while we were alive and that it is very similar of a vibe I imagine. \n",
      "Brennan: And there's this element that the historian was basically saying was like, as much as government various governments have bungled the response to this. The fact that there has been a species wide, coordinated effort to actually have us be smart enough to all fight a disease by just staying away from each other, having the technological ability to coordinate that, having the I know, my little happy place has been that as much as there's shit that we're doing wrong and we're not taking seriously enough, the fact that like, we just extended the stay-at-home order in LA that's the right thing to do. And the fact that human beings have the ability to communicate, coordinate, take things seriously, and respond in ways that are literally as history making as the circumstances themselves that prompted it fills me with a sense of while fragile a sense of hope and pride. That's how I feel. \n",
      "Zac: Oh. (laughs) \n",
      "Ally: Yeah, definitely. \n",
      "Brennan: Yeah, this is a great one. A great question from I believe it's either Nita or Neda. Thank you so much for the question. \n",
      "“Hey, gang, thank you so much for this riveting entertainment. My heart is still racing as I ask my question, which is, do you guys do anything to warm up together or just align your vibes as a party before a session? Thanks again, hope you're staying safe, Lots of love.” \n",
      "Ally: So it's like a mini toothbrush. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Lou: It’s called a wisp\n",
      "Ally: About this big And everyone just puts a wisp in their mouth. It looks not unlike this honestly (holds up their airpod)\n",
      "Siobhan: It does, it's a very similar vibe. We wisped a lot for this season. \n",
      "Ally: Ceremonial wisps. \n",
      "Siobhan: We really got really into wisp very bad for the environment. \n",
      "Emily: Yeah can kind of take one and much like linking arms to take a drink? You can do that with a Wisp. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yes. \n",
      "Zac: And just for like two or three minutes, sort of. gently I guess brush your teeth. I don't really have anything else to call it. \n",
      "Siobhan: Brush and chew at the same time. \n",
      "Emily: Yeah, I was gonna say make sure you bite down or you're missing out on some of that good juice. \n",
      "Ally: And then you just throw it directly into a duck's mouth. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yes. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Ally: You do like, oh that was a nice (mimes throwing)\n",
      "Lou: That’s how we decide initiative orders is whoever gets in the ducks mouth first, I go first and everyone follows. \n",
      "Murph: We do have dice games that we... What we used to do we used to get all the ones out. \n",
      "Emily: We used to get out the ones \n",
      "Murph: We used to get out the ones and then it eventually evolved. This is more during Fantasy High Live, but we had that impossible game where you'd try and... \n",
      "Siobhan: It was something that Murph started and we made fun of him and then immediately started playing. \n",
      "Murph: It will ruin your life. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yeah, it's bad. \n",
      "Murph: It's a D4, a D6, D8, D10, D12 and a D20 and you go in order and you try to roll the highest version, and you can only keep going if you have to restart if you ever miss it so like roll the D4 if you get a three start over. Roll the D4 get a four go to the next one roll the D6 if you get a two gotta roll the D4 again you go back to the beginning. You gotta roll all them \n",
      "Zac: It gives me anxiety thinking of it. \n",
      "Murph: We got through the D10 though \n",
      "Emily: This is the anal retentive but we also just go back and forth wildly saying if rolling D20s and be like if I get a D20. Murphy has roll with a little beans. And only little beans for the rest of his life. \n",
      "Zac: Yeah, for example, I have this dash right here and if I roll a nat 20, Murph has to hold his headphones over his eyes like they're like a bar like he's a Star Trek. (rolls dice) I got a nine. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Murph: That’s always how it ends\n",
      "Ally: Wait, I have one \n",
      "Emily: There was an entire day that was a if I get a nat 20 Murph has to buy Joe Biden’s son... \n",
      "Ally: That's what I was gonna do. \n",
      "Lou: Hunter Biden? \n",
      "Ally: If I get a nat 20 you have to buy Hunter Biden a Nintendo switch. (Rolls) a 4\n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Murph: I think you got one and I just said no. \n",
      "Zac: What's the status on that? Did you send Hunter Biden a Switch\n",
      "Emily: I secretly sent one from our joint account\n",
      "Lou: You still have to send him a switch \n",
      "Ally: with the Animal Crossing. \n",
      "Murph: That was never part of it \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Zac: He just should though \n",
      "Ally: I just want him to be happy. \n",
      "S-You don’t want to have a switch with no games on it that's so sad. \n",
      "Ally: Yeah. We couldn't do that to him, poor Hunter Biden. \n",
      "Emily: So that's a very, very formal warm up training that we have. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Murph: If I get a nat 20, Murph has to do something bad. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Zac: No consequences for ourselves \n",
      "Siobhan: 95% us bullying Murph is what our warm up is\n",
      "Murph: It's like 60% me but then sometimes other people get thrown in. \n",
      "Siobhan: Yes. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Emily: Then we instituted the rule if you rolled a one when you were challenging something with Murph, then you have to do it yourself. \n",
      "Zac: Usually what would happen for me was enrolling one and I just get really quiet and not talk about it. \n",
      "Murph: Low stakes ones were always the scariest because you would probably like, somebody will make you do it. \n",
      "Siobhan: That means actually I get to buy Hunter Biden a switch but it's like at it's shut off at some point during. \n",
      "Murph: Yeah its like if I roll the D20, you'll have to drink your whole coffee right now in five seconds. Yeah, you don't wanna do that. \n",
      "Brennan: So that's basically what the warm ups are like. That's what you can see that's sort of the vibe. This next one's from Quite Bad Weather. \n",
      "“First while I've loved every P...\n",
      "Zac: The quite? \n",
      "Brennan: The quite bad weather, thanks quite bad weather. \n",
      "“First of all, I've loved every PC in D-20. I genuinely never loved and related to anyone more than Lapin. Thanks, Zac. Now serious question for Brennan. Bimathy, Belizabeth, Bonathan please explain.” \n",
      "Well, thank you for the kind words First of all about dearly departed Lapin. When you take a name that doesn't have a B in front of it, and you put a B in front of it, it gets way funnier. And that's basically what that's about. Bemily Axford, Biobhan Thompson. Inherently funny names. \n",
      "Biobhan: We had a run of characters. \n",
      "Bemily: Yeah \n",
      "Bally: Bally. Beardly\n",
      "Biobhan: Bally. \n",
      "Bac: Bally fitness \n",
      "Bou: I was signing for a minute as Bou Bilson because of how funny it was. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Bemily: If your check doesn't make people laugh, it wont cash \n",
      "Bou: Won’t cash dude. I have to write Bou Bilson. Bank they go (laugh) right into the money bin. \n",
      "Brennan: I'm so sorry Mr, Bilson. It looks like there's been an issue with your check You signed it Lou Wilson. \n",
      "Bou: I'm sorry, that's my name. \n",
      "Bac: It seems as if you've never done your taxes. \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Bou: Oh Lou Wilson does his taxes, but Bou Bilson? \n",
      "Burph: And you are Bou Bilson also so you taking out a social security card in this name? \n",
      "Bou: No, no, because I have the current taxes.\n",
      "Burph: That’s a crime sir \n",
      "Bou: Well come on we’re all having fun here at the bank\n",
      "(laughs)\n",
      "My bank is a laugh riot is what I'm saying. \n",
      "Biobhan: Bank's original name is Tank it's funnier. \n",
      "Bou: Exactly \n",
      "(hysterical laugh) \n",
      "Brennan: This last one gang was from Tommy McMillan. Thanks Tommy. \n",
      "“Thank you guys for making such a funny show everyone is such a pleasure to watch. You guys are amazing. I wish I could describe how great everyone is. Thank you for making D-20.” \n",
      "Tommy that's not a question that's just a nice thank you. \n",
      "Siobhan: Tommy read the assignment, \n",
      "(laughs) \n",
      "Lou: Go back again read the assignment. \n",
      "Brennan: Read the assignment, that's so kind of you to say. This was an absolute doozy of an episode. And doing an anthology show we like, go to different genres. So we know there's a bunch of people that signed up for Dimension 20 for a bunch of rude teens and their rad adventures and are now deep in a brutally lethal Game of Thrones so \n",
      "Siobhan: There is still rude teens and their rad adventures in this season \n",
      "Brennan: That's true \n",
