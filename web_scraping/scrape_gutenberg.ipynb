      "\n",
      "The Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting \"Frankenstein\" for\n",
      "one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with\n",
      "some account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to\n",
      "comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so\n",
      "very frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of,\n",
      "and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very\n",
      "averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only\n",
      "appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be\n",
      "confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I\n",
      "can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished\n",
      "literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing.\n",
      "As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given\n",
      "me for recreation, was to \"write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure\n",
      "than this, which was the formation of castles in the air--the indulging\n",
      "in waking dreams--the following up trains of thought, which had for\n",
      "their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My\n",
      "dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In\n",
      "the latter I was a close imitator--rather doing as others had done,\n",
      "than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was\n",
      "intended at least for one other eye--my childhood's companion and\n",
      "friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody;\n",
      "they were my refuge when annoyed--my dearest pleasure when free.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable\n",
      "time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque\n",
      "parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern\n",
      "shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call\n",
      "them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and\n",
      "the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of\n",
      "my fancy. I wrote then--but in a most common-place style. It was beneath\n",
      "the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides\n",
      "of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy\n",
      "flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself\n",
      "the heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place an affair\n",
      "as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes or\n",
      "wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own\n",
      "identity, and I could people the hours with creations far more\n",
      "interesting to me at that age, than my own sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction.\n",
      "My husband, however, was from the first, very anxious that I should\n",
      "prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of\n",
      "fame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which\n",
      "even on my own part I cared for then, though since I have become\n",
      "infinitely indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I should\n",
      "write, not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy\n",
      "of notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the\n",
      "promise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling, and\n",
      "the cares of a family, occupied my time; and study, in the way of\n",
      "reading, or improving my ideas in communication with his far more\n",
      "cultivated mind, was all of literary employment that engaged my\n",
      "attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours\n",
      "of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or\n",
      "wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto\n",
      "of Childe Harold, was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon\n",
      "paper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the\n",
      "light and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of\n",
      "heaven and earth, whose influences we partook with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined\n",
      "us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from\n",
      "the German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of\n",
      "the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he\n",
      "had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her\n",
      "whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his\n",
      "race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the\n",
      "younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of\n",
      "promise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet,\n",
      "in complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by\n",
      "the moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The\n",
      "shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate\n",
      "swung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he\n",
      "advanced to the couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep.\n",
      "Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead\n",
      "of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the\n",
      "stalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are\n",
      "as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will each write a ghost story,\" said Lord Byron; and his proposition\n",
      "was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a\n",
      "fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley,\n",
      "more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant\n",
      "imagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our\n",
      "language, than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded\n",
      "on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible\n",
      "idea about a skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through\n",
      "a key-hole--what to see I forget--something very shocking and wrong of\n",
      "course; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned\n",
      "Tom of Coventry, he did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to\n",
      "despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she\n",
      "was fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of\n",
      "prose, speedily relinquished their uncongenial task.\n",
      "\n",
      "I busied myself _to think of a story_,--a story to rival those which had\n",
      "excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears\n",
      "of our nature, and awaken thrilling horror--one to make the reader dread\n",
      "to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the\n",
      "heart. If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be\n",
      "unworthy of its name. I thought and pondered--vainly. I felt that blank\n",
      "incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship,\n",
      "when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. _Have you thought\n",
      "of a story?_ I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to\n",
      "reply with a mortifying negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and that\n",
      "beginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give\n",
      "the world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand\n",
      "upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist\n",
      "in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the\n",
      "first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless\n",
      "substances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself. In all\n",
      "matters of discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the\n",
      "imagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and\n",
      "his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the\n",
      "capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning\n",
      "ideas suggested to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to\n",
      "which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these,\n",
      "various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the\n",
      "nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability\n",
      "of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the\n",
      "experiments of Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did,\n",
      "or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken\n",
      "of as having been done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a\n",
      "glass case, till by some extraordinary means it began to move with\n",
      "voluntary motion. Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a\n",
      "corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things:\n",
      "perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought\n",
      "together, and endued with vital warmth.\n",

N. Woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the happenings are repeated and all dates may not be correct,\\r\\nfor be it remembered that Mr. Woodcock has written all from memory.\\r\\nIt is doubtful if he kept all copies of H-T-T, therefore was not sure\\r\\nif such and such incidents had been written before. In most cases\\r\\nthese are somewhat different and as they all \"fit in\" we have used\\r\\nthem as written and published from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch information is also contained in the writings of Mr. Woodcock\\r\\nand whether you use gun, steel traps, deadfalls or snares, you will\\r\\nfind something of value. The articles are also written in a style\\r\\nthat impresses all of their truthfulness, but, so written that they\\r\\nare very interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of our readers who have read his articles will be glad of this\\r\\nopportunity to get his writings in book form, while those that have\\r\\nonly read a few of his more recent articles will be pleased to secure\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the following editorial which appeared in H-T-T will be in\\r\\nplace here:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Although crippled with rheumatism, there is an old hunter and\\r\\ntrapper living in Potter County, Pa., whose enthusiasm is high and\\r\\nhis greatest desire is still to get out over the trap lines a few\\r\\nseasons before the end of the \"trail\" of life\\'s journey is reached.\\r\\nMay that desire be fulfilled is the earnest wish of the H-T-T as well\\r\\nas thousands of our readers, who have read the writings of this\\r\\nkind-hearted and wide experienced hunter and trapper, as they have been\\r\\npenned from his home near the Allegheny Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is with pleasure that we publish in this issue the \"Autobiography\\r\\nof E. N. Woodcock as a Trapper.\" During his half century with trap\\r\\nand gun, he has had some narrow escapes and experiences, but not the\\r\\nmany \"hair-breadth escapes\" that some claim, but which only occur on\\r\\npaper. Mr. Woodcock is a truthful man, and you can read his\\r\\nautobiography knowing that it is the truth even to the minutest\\r\\ndetail.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe autobiography was written by Mr. Woodcock at the request of the\\r\\nEditor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper in the spring of 1908 and published\\r\\nJuly of the same year. We are glad to add that since that time, Mr.\\r\\nWoodcock has enjoyed several hunting and trapping expeditions. Some\\r\\nwere in his home state--Pennsylvania--on same grounds, or at least\\r\\nnear those he camped on many, many years ago. He also took a couple\\r\\nof trips into the south--fall of 1911 and 1912. He was in Tennessee,\\r\\nAlabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. An account of these hunts is\\r\\ngiven in Chapters XXX, XXXI and XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May, 1912, the Editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper visited Mr.\\r\\nWoodcock and family at their home some four miles from Coudersport,\\r\\nPennsylvania. Mr. Woodcock, though physically not large, is a\\r\\nwonderful man in the \"ways of the woods.\" He is not given to\\r\\nexaggeration or boasting like many a man who has followed the Trail\\r\\nand Trap Line. Every word that he says or writes can be put down as\\r\\ntruthful beyond a doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time, (May, 1912) he was afraid he would never be able to get\\r\\nout on the trap line again, as he was suffering from rheumatism and\\r\\nheart trouble. Towards fall he became better, and enjoyed the sport,\\r\\nwhich for more than fifty years has been his--may he be spared to\\r\\nenjoy many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy noting the dates as given in connection with various articles\\r\\npublished, it will be seen that Mr. Woodcock shortly after 1900 began\\r\\nto point out the need of protection to game and fur animals. After a\\r\\nlife on the trap and trail of more than fifty years, such advice\\r\\nshould be far reaching. Mr. Woodcock is a man of unusual foresight\\r\\nand knowing that he is nearing the end of the trail, wishes to\\r\\nforcibly impress the needs of protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy referring to a good map, you will be able to see the location of\\r\\nmany of Mr. Woodcock\\'s hunting, camping and trapping trips, as he\\r\\ngenerally mentions State, County and Streams.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few men have had wider experience than Mr. Woodcock. He knows\\r\\nfrom more than a half century much of the habits and characteristics\\r\\nof animals. He gives his reasons why marten are plentiful in one\\r\\nsection and are gone in a few days. His reason too, looks plausible.\\r\\nHe describes trapping wolves in Upper Michigan about 1880, also\\r\\nbeaver. Tells how he caught the \"shadow of the forests\" as wolves are\\r\\noften called by trappers--they are so hard to trap. By reading of his\\r\\nmany experiences you will not only enjoy what he says, but will get\\r\\nfacts about bear, deer, fox, wolves, mink, marten and other fur\\r\\nbearers that you had never thought of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man, while on the \"trail\" upwards of fifty years, so far as\\r\\nknown never killed out of season or trapped unprime furs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA WORD FROM MR. WOODCOCK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editor of HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER has requested a foreword of\\r\\nintroductory to FIFTY YEARS A HUNTER AND TRAPPER OR EXPERIENCE OF E.\\r\\nN. WOODCOCK, saying that so many have enjoyed my articles, which have\\r\\nappeared from time to time in HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER, extending over a\\r\\nperiod of some ten years, 1903 to 1913, that same are to be published\\r\\nin book form.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born at Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania, August 30,\\r\\n1844. From early childhood, my nature led me to the Forests and\\r\\nStreams. I have hunted in many of the states of the Far West\\r\\nincluding the three Pacific States--California, Oregon and\\r\\nWashington. I killed my first panther or cougar in the mountains of\\r\\nIdaho on the headwaters of the Clearwater river. My first real\\r\\nexperience in wolfing was in Southeastern Oregon. I met my greatest\\r\\nnumber of deer in Northwestern California.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have trapped of late years, in nearly all of the states east of the\\r\\nMississippi river and also on the White River of Arkansas; also\\r\\ntrapped bear and other fur bearing animals and hunted deer in\\r\\nNorthern Michigan, also forty years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother sport which I enjoyed was the \"pigeon days.\" I have netted\\r\\nwild pigeons from the Adirondack Mountains in New York state to\\r\\nIndian Territory--now Oklahoma--trapping them in the states of\\r\\nMichigan, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy nature led me to the Trail and Trap line from early childhood and\\r\\nI have trapped bear and hunted deer in the mountains of Pennsylvania\\r\\nfor more than 50 years--half a century--and my picture with my two\\r\\nfoxes on my shoulder shows me on the trap line for the season of\\r\\n1912-13.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 1, 1913.    E. N. WOODCOCK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutobiography of E. N. Woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born on the 30th day of August, A. D. 1844, in a little village\\r\\nby the name of Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Lymansville\\r\\nwas named after my grandparent, Isaac Lyman, or better known as Major\\r\\nLyman, having held office of that rank in the Revolutionary War. It\\r\\nis from this limb of the family that I inherited that uncontrollable\\r\\ndesire for the trap, gun and the wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a very early age it was my greatest delight to have all the mice,\\r\\nsquirrels and groundhogs and in later years young raccoons, young fox\\r\\nand every other varmint or wild animal that I could catch or could\\r\\nget from other sources, and at times I had quite a menagerie.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began trapping at a very early age, the same as many boys do who\\r\\nlive out in the country where they have an opportunity. My father\\r\\nowned a grist mill and a sawmill. These mills were about one-half\\r\\nmile apart and it was about these mills and along the mill races and\\r\\nponds of these mills that I set my first traps for muskrats, mink and\\r\\ncoon. Before I was stout enough to set a trap which was strong enough\\r\\nto hold the varmint, it was necessary for me to get some older person\\r\\nto set the trap. I would take the trap to the intended place and set\\r\\nfor the particular animals I was in quest of, whether mink, coon or\\r\\nrat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those days clearings were small, woods large and full of game.\\r\\nDeer could be seen in bunches every morning in the fields and it was\\r\\nnot uncommon to see a bear\\'s track near the house that had been made\\r\\nduring the night. Wolves were not plenty though it was a common thing\\r\\nto see their tracks and sometimes hear them howl on the hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other boys who lead an outdoor life, I grew stronger each year\\r\\nand as I grew older and stronger my trap lines grew longer and my\\r\\nhunts took me farther into the woods. Finally as game became scarcer\\r\\nmy hunts grew from a few hours in length to weeks and months camping\\r\\nin a cabin built in the woods in a section where game was plenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of thirteen while out with a party of men on a hunting and\\r\\nfishing trip, I killed my first bear. While I had now been out each\\r\\nfall with my traps and gun, it was not until I was about eighteen\\r\\nyears old that I took my first lesson from an old and experienced\\r\\ntrapper, a man nearly eighty years old and a trapper and hunter from\\r\\nboyhood. The man\\'s name was Aleck Harris. We made our camp in the\\r\\nextreme southeastern part of this (Potter) County in a section known\\r\\nas \"The Black Forest\" and it was here that I learned many things from\\r\\nan experienced trapper and hunter that served me well on the trap\\r\\nline and the trail, in the years that followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was here that I made my first bed in a foot or more of snow with a\\r\\nfire against a fallen tree and a few boughs thrown on the ground for\\r\\na bed. At other times perhaps a bear skin just removed from the bear\\r\\nfor covering, or I might have no covering other than to remove my\\r\\ncoat and spread it over me. This I have often done when belated on\\r\\nthe trail so that I was unable to reach the cabin and was happy and\\r\\ncontented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was here I first learned to do up the saddles or the carcass of a\\r\\ndeer in the more convenient way to carry. It was here that I took my\\r\\nfirst practical lessons in skinning, stretching, curing and handling\\r\\nof skins and furs. I also learned many things of traps and trapping\\r\\nand to do away with sheath knives and other unnecessary burdens on\\r\\nthe trap line. In my younger days I preferred to \"go it alone\" when\\r\\nin a country that I was familiar with and many a week I have spent in\\r\\nmy cabin alone save for my faithful dog, but as I grew older and\\r\\nbecame afflicted with rheumatism I have found a partner more\\r\\nacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have met with many queer circumstances while on the trap line and\\r\\ntrail, yet I have never met with any of those bloodcurdling and\\r\\nhair-breadth escapes from wild animals which are mostly \"pipe dreams\".\\r\\nPerhaps the nearest I ever came to being seriously hurt by a wild\\r\\nanimal was from a large buck deer. It was in November and on a stormy\\r\\nday. I had killed a doe and was in the act of dressing the doe and\\r\\nwas leaning over the deer at work. I was within a few feet of a\\r\\nfallen tree. Hearing a slight noise, I raised up to see what caused\\r\\nit, when with the speed of a cannon ball a buck flew past me, barely\\r\\nmissing and landed six or eight feet beyond me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deer had come up to this fallen tree on the track of the doe and\\r\\nseeing me at work over the doe, became angered and sprung at me and\\r\\nonly my straightening up at the very instant that I did saved me from\\r\\nbeing seriously hurt or perhaps killed. I sprang over the log. The\\r\\ndeer stood and gazed at me for a moment. His eyes were of a green hue\\r\\nand the hair on his back all stuck up towards his head. After gazing\\r\\nat me for a moment the deer walked slowly away. The suddenness of the\\r\\noccurrence so unnerved me that I was unable to shoot for some minutes\\r\\nthough my gun was standing against the tree within reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another time I was somewhat frightened by what I supposed was a\\r\\ndead bear suddenly coming to life. I had caught the bear in a trap\\r\\nand it had got fastened in some saplings growing on the steep bank of\\r\\na small brook. I shot the bear in the head, as I thought, and it fell\\r\\nover the bank in such a manner that his whole weight was held by the\\r\\nleg that was fast in the trap. I was unable to release it from the\\r\\ntrap where it was hanging as I had no clamp to put the trap springs\\r\\ndown with, to release the bear\\'s foot. I had set my gun, a single\\r\\nbarrel rifle, against a tree without reloading it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cut the bear\\'s paw off close to the trap which allowed the animal\\r\\nto roll down the bank to level ground. I had begun to rip down the\\r\\nleg that had been caught in the trap. A lad of about ten years was\\r\\nwith me having accompanied me to attend the traps that day. The lad\\r\\nstood looking on when all of a sudden he said, \"See him wink.\" I\\r\\nstopped my work and glanced at the bear\\'s eyes and sure enough he was\\r\\nwinking and winking fast, too, and almost before I knew it the bear\\r\\nwas trying to get onto his feet. My gun was unloaded and the lad was\\r\\nscreaming at the top of his voice, \"Kill him! Kill him!\" But what was\\r\\nI to kill him with? Nothing came to my mind at first except to use my\\r\\ngun as a club but I did not like to break it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment I thought of my hatchet which I had taken from the\\r\\nholster and laid on the bank where I had cut the bear\\'s foot off to\\r\\nrelease him from the trap. I grabbed the hatchet and one good blow on\\r\\nthe head put a stop to the rumpus and nobody harmed, although the boy\\r\\nwas badly frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another time I might have got into trouble with a bear also caught\\r\\nin a trap. I was quite young at this time. I had gone some ten or\\r\\ntwelve miles from home and set a trap for a bear. The trap was rather\\r\\na poor one with a very light chain for a bear trap. I had only set\\r\\nthe trap a few days before yet I thought I must go and look after it,\\r\\nbut it was more the desire to be in the woods than it was of\\r\\nexpecting to have a bear in the trap at that time. I did not take a\\r\\ngun with me, only a revolver loaded as I had no more balls and this\\r\\nwas before the days of fixed ammunition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to the trap there was an ugly bear in it and he had the\\r\\nclog fast in some roots and among some fallen trees. After firing one\\r\\nshot at the Bear\\'s head, which I missed, I then shot the two\\r\\nremaining balls into the bear\\'s body with the only effect of making\\r\\nhim more determined to get at me. I now cut a good club determined to\\r\\nput a quietus on Bruin in that manner but after landing several blows\\r\\nmy knees began to feel weak. I gave up the job and returned home\\r\\nleaving Bruin in the trap feeling as well as he did when I first\\r\\nfound him, so far as I was able to see. But when I returned the next\\r\\nmorning with help and now with a regular gun we found Bruin nearly\\r\\ndead and helpless from the shots that I had given him the day before\\r\\nfrom the revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have met with other circumstances not quite so fascinating as those\\r\\njust related. At one time a young companion and I were camping and\\r\\ntrapping several miles from home and several miles from a road. One\\r\\nday while we were some ways out from camp setting traps my friend\\r\\nbecame suddenly very ill. It required no skilled doctor to see that\\r\\nit was a case that must have help at once. I started with my friend\\r\\nto get to camp. While my companion was not as old as I, he was larger\\r\\nand heavier. I worked along with him, half carrying him, while he\\r\\nwould support himself as best he could. I got him within about a mile\\r\\nof the cabin when he completely gave out and could go no farther and\\r\\nwith all my pleadings I could not get him to try to go any farther,\\r\\nbut he promised that if I went after help that after resting he would\\r\\nwork his way to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing that there was no other way to do, I left him and started for\\r\\nhelp. It was now dark. My way was over a road of about twelve miles\\r\\nand nearly all the way through a thick woods and part of the way\\r\\nwithout a road other than a path. When I reached the cabin I stopped\\r\\nlong enough to build a fire so that the cabin would be warm when my\\r\\ncompanion got there if he did get there at all, which I doubted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a lunch in my hand and started for help. I would take a trot\\r\\nwhenever the woods were sufficiently open to let in light enough so\\r\\nthat I could see my way. I got to my companion\\'s home about midnight\\r\\nand we were soon on the way back with a team and wagon while my\\r\\ncompanion\\'s father went after a doctor to have him there when we got\\r\\nback with the patient. We drove with the wagon as far as the road\\r\\nwould allow, then we left the wagon and rode the horses to the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached the cabin, contrary to expectations, we found my\\r\\ncompanion there but very sick. We lost no time in getting him onto a\\r\\nhorse and starting for the wagon where we had a bed for the patient\\r\\nto lie down on. We got home about eight o\\'clock in the morning. The\\r\\ndoctor was waiting for us and he said as soon as he looked at the man\\r\\nthat it was a bad case of typhoid fever. He was right, for it took\\r\\nmany weeks before my friend was able to be out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen game began to get scarce, that is when game was no longer found\\r\\nplenty right at the door, I began to look for parts where game was\\r\\nplentiful and accordingly, with three companions, I arranged to hunt\\r\\nand trap on Thunder Bay River in Michigan, where deer and all kinds\\r\\nof game, we had been told, were plenty and also lots of fur bearers.\\r\\nThis we found to be quite true but the state had passed a law\\r\\nforbidding the shipment of deer. We did not know this when we left\\r\\nhome and two of the boys soon got discouraged and returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was while hunting here that I had another trip of twenty miles\\r\\nthrough the woods over rough corduroy tote road in the night after a\\r\\nteam to take my companion (Vanater by name) out to Alpena to have a\\r\\nbroken leg set. He was carrying a deer on his shoulder and when near\\r\\ncamp it was necessary to cross a small stream to get to the cabin. We\\r\\nhad felled a small tree across the creek for the purpose of crossing.\\r\\nThere was three or four inches of snow on the log and after my\\r\\ncompanion was across the creek and just as he was about to step from\\r\\nthe log he slipped and fell, striking his leg across the log in some\\r\\nmanner so that it broke between the knee and ankle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter getting my companion to camp and making him as comfortable as\\r\\npossible, I took a lunch in my knapsack and with an old tin lantern\\r\\nwith a tallow candle in it, which gave about as much light as a\\r\\nlightning bug, I started over the longest and roughest twenty miles\\r\\nof road that I ever traveled in the night. Sometimes I would trip on\\r\\nsome stick or log and fall and put out my light but I would get up,\\r\\nlight the candle in the lantern again and hurry on all the faster to\\r\\nmake up for lost time. I made the journey all right and was back to\\r\\ncamp the next day before noon where we found my companion doing as\\r\\nwell as could be expected under the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got my companion out to Alpena where the doctor set the leg and in\\r\\nthe course of two or three weeks he was so far recovered that he was\\r\\nable to return to camp and keep me company until he was able to again\\r\\ntake up the trap line and trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years later I again went back to Michigan and hunted deer and\\r\\ntrapped on the Manistee, Boardman and Rapid Rivers, but I found game\\r\\nand furs had become somewhat scarce in that part so I next went with\\r\\na partner to upper Michigan. At that time there was no railroad in\\r\\nUpper Michigan and but few settlers, after leaving the Straits, until\\r\\nnear Lake Superior and near the copper and iron mines.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have tried my luck in three of the states west of the Rocky\\r\\nMountains. In the Clear Water regions of Idaho there was a fair\\r\\nshowing of big game, with a good sprinkling of the fur bearers,\\r\\nincluding a bunch of beaver here and there. (Beaver protected.) I\\r\\nheard men tell of there being plenty of grizzly and silver tip bear\\r\\nbut I saw no signs of them. In California a trapper told, me of a\\r\\nlarge grizzly coming to his shack in the night. He said that he was\\r\\ncooking venison and that he had the fresh meat of a deer in the shack\\r\\nand he thought that the bear smelled the meat was what brought him\\r\\nthere. The man said the bear smelled around the shack awhile and then\\r\\nbegan to dig at one corner of the shack and soon pulled out the\\r\\nbottom log. The man kept quiet until the bear pulled out the next log\\r\\nand put his head in through the hole when he put a ball between the\\r\\nbear\\'s eyes that fixed Bruin too quick. (A bad case of nightmare.) I\\r\\nthink it doubtful if there is a grizzly bear or at least very few now\\r\\nto be found south of the British Columbia line.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best catch of bear in one season with a partner was eleven. Years\\r\\nago I caught from three to six bear each season but late years I have\\r\\nnot caught more than one to three. I think that of late the heavy\\r\\nlumbering going on through Northern Pennsylvania had something to do\\r\\nwith the catch of bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe timber in Pennsylvania is largely cut away now leaving bark\\r\\nslashings which make fine shelter for bear and wildcats and both\\r\\nanimals were apparently quite plenty I would judge from the number\\r\\ncaught in this section, fall of 1907. Deer are very scarce in this\\r\\nstate, perhaps the most to be found are in Pike County.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can lay claim to one thing that but few hunters and trappers can\\r\\ndo, that is for forty years I lost only two seasons from the trap\\r\\nline and the trail and each time I was detained by rheumatism. Once\\r\\nbeing taken down with sciatica while in the camp trapping and\\r\\nhunting, and it held me to my bed for several months hard and tight.\\r\\nI still have the greater part of my trapping and hunting outfit, and\\r\\nam still in hopes to be able to get out on the line and pinch a few\\r\\nmore toes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I promised to write something of my early experience at trapping\\r\\nand hunting, I will begin by saying that I am now living within one\\r\\nmile of where I was born sixty years ago (this was written in 1904),\\r\\nand that I began my trapping career by first trapping rats in my\\r\\nfather\\'s grist mill with the old figure four squat trap. I well\\r\\nremember the many war dances that I had when I could not make the\\r\\ntrap stay set; but I did not trap long inside the mill for father\\r\\nalso ran a blacksmith shop and always kept a good man to do the work\\r\\nin the shop. I was soon coaxing the smith to make me a steel trap,\\r\\nwhich he did. I now began catching muskrats along the tail race and\\r\\nabout the mill dam, but the spring on my trap was so stiff that when\\r\\nI found the trap sprung or found game in it, I was obliged to bring\\r\\nthe trap to the house and have some one older than I to set it. Then\\r\\nI would carry it back to the creek and set it. Well this was slow\\r\\nwork and I was continually begging the blacksmith to make me more\\r\\ntraps with weaker springs so I could set them myself. After much\\r\\ncoaxing he made me three more which I was able to set and then the\\r\\nmuskrats began to suffer. Let me say at that time a muskrat skin was\\r\\nworth more than a mink skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoys, I was like a man in public office, the more of it they have,\\r\\nthe more they want. So it was with me in regard to the traps, but I\\r\\ncould not coax the blacksmith to make any more. An older brother came\\r\\nto my aid in this way: he told me to go to town and see the\\r\\nblacksmith there and see if I could not sell some charcoal to him for\\r\\ntraps, and he, (my brother) would help me burn the coal. Now this\\r\\nburning the coal was done by gathering hemlock knots from old rotten\\r\\nlogs and piling them up and covering them like potato holes, leaving\\r\\na hole open at the bottom to start the fire. After the fire was well\\r\\nstarted the hole was closed and the knots smoldered for several days.\\r\\nWell, the plan worked and by the operation I became the possessor of\\r\\nfive more traps. By this time the vicinity of the mill dam and race\\r\\nwas no longer large enough to furnish trapping grounds, and I\\r\\nventured farther up and down the stream and took in the coon and mink\\r\\nalong with the muskrat.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW, RESIDENCE AND HIS DOG\\r\\nMACK.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a neighbor, Washburn by name, who was considered a great\\r\\ntrapper, for he could now and then catch a fox. As time passed by, I\\r\\nbegan to have a great desire to get on an equal with Mr. Washburn and\\r\\ncatch a fox. I began to urge him to allow me to go with him to see\\r\\nhow he set his trap, and after a long time coaxing, he granted my\\r\\nrequest. I found what everyone of today knows of the chaff bed set.\\r\\nYou may now know that it was not long before I had a bed made near a\\r\\nbarn that stood well back in the field, and after much worry and many\\r\\nwakeful nights I caught a fox and I thought myself Lord Jonathan. As\\r\\ntime went by, and by chance I learned that by mixing a goodly part of\\r\\nhen manure with plenty of feathers in it, and mixing it with the\\r\\nchaff, it was a great improvement on chaff alone. Next I learned of\\r\\nthe well known water set. However, I perhaps set different from the\\r\\nmost of trappers in making this set. Well as all trappers learn from\\r\\nlong years of experience, so have I, and those old-fashioned sets are\\r\\nlike the squat traps, not up-to-date. I will now drop the trapping\\r\\nquestion for a time and tell you how I killed my first deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust outside of the clearing on father\\'s farm and not more than fifty\\r\\nrods from the house was a wet place, such as are known to these parts\\r\\nas a \"bear wallow.\" This wet place had been salted and was what is\\r\\ncalled a \"salt lick.\" In those days it was not an uncommon thing to\\r\\nsee six or eight deer in the field any morning during the summer\\r\\nseason--the same as you will see them in parts of California today.\\r\\nIt was not an uncommon thing for my older brother to kill a deer at\\r\\nthis lick any morning or evening, but that was not making a nimrod of\\r\\nme. I would beg father to let me take the gun (which was an old\\r\\ndouble barreled flintlock shot gun) and watch the lick. As I was only\\r\\nnine years old, they would not allow me to have the gun, so I was\\r\\nobliged to steal it out when no one was in sight, carry it to the\\r\\nbarn and then watch my opportunity and \"skipper\" from the barn to the\\r\\nlick. All worked smoothly and I got to the lick all right. It was\\r\\ntoward sundown and I had scarcely poked the gun through the hole in\\r\\nthe blind and looked out when I saw two or three deer coming toward\\r\\nthe lick. I cocked the old gun and made ready but about this time I\\r\\nwas taken with the worst chill that any boy ever had and I shook so\\r\\nthat I could scarcely hold the gun to the peep hole. It was only a\\r\\nmoment when two of the deer stepped into the lick, and I took the\\r\\nbest aim I could under the condition, and pulled the trigger. Well of\\r\\nall the bawling a deer ever made, I think this one did the worst, but\\r\\nI did not stop to see what I had done but took across the field to\\r\\nthe house at a lively gait, leaving the gun in the blind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe folks heard the shot and saw me running for the house at\\r\\nbreak-neck speed (this of course was the first that they knew I was out\\r\\nwith the gun). My older brother came to meet me and see what the\\r\\ntrouble was. When I told him what I had done, he went with me to the\\r\\nlick and there we found a fair-sized buck wallowing in the lick with\\r\\nhis back broken, one buck shot (or rather one slug, for the gun was\\r\\nloaded with pieces cut from a bar of lead); one slug had struck and\\r\\nbroken the spine and this was the cause of the deer bawling so loud\\r\\nas this was the only one that hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old shotgun was now taken from its usual corner in the kitchen\\r\\nand hung up over the mantle piece above the big fire place and well\\r\\nout of my reach. This did not stop my hunting. We had a neighbor who\\r\\nhad two or three guns and he would lend me one of them. I would hide\\r\\naway hen eggs and take them to the grocery and trade them for powder\\r\\nand shot. Of course the man who owned the gun got the game, when I\\r\\nchanced to kill any, for I did not dare to carry it home. It was not\\r\\nlong until father found that I was borrowing Mr. Abbott\\'s gun, and he\\r\\nthought that if hunt I would, it would be better that I use our own\\r\\nand then he would know when I was out with it. He took the old\\r\\nflintlock to the gunsmith and had it fixed over into a cap lock, and\\r\\nnow I was rigged out with both gun and traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now tell you about the first bear that I killed. I was about\\r\\nthirteen years old, and it was not so common a thing for one to kill\\r\\na bear in those days as it is now (1904), for strange as it may seem,\\r\\nbears are far more plentiful here today than they were at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of my brothers and three or four of the neighbors went into the\\r\\nwoods about twelve miles and bought fifty acres of land. There was no\\r\\none living within six or seven miles of the place. They cleared off\\r\\nfour or five acres and built a good log fence around it. They also\\r\\nbuilt a small barn and cabin. Each spring they would drive their\\r\\nyoung cattle out to this place, stay a few days and plant a few\\r\\npotatoes, and some corn. About once a month it was customary to go\\r\\nover to this clearing and hunt up the cattle and bring them to the\\r\\nclearing and salt them, then have a day or two of trout fishing,\\r\\nwatch licks and kill a deer or two, jerk the meat and have a general\\r\\ngood time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was allowed to go on one of these expeditions, and the first night\\r\\nthe men watched one or two licks and one of the men killed a deer,\\r\\nbut I had to stay in camp that night with a promise that I should\\r\\nwatch the second night.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first night we heard wolves howl away upon the hills. The\\r\\nnext morning the men talked very mysteriously about the wolves and\\r\\nsaid that it would not be safe to watch the licks that night, that no\\r\\ndeer would come to the licks as long as the wolves were around. I\\r\\ntook it all in and said nothing, but was determined to watch a lick\\r\\nthat night. Finally one of the men, John Duell by name, said that I\\r\\ncould watch the lick that he had and he would stay in camp. The one\\r\\nthat I was to watch was only a short distance from the clearing. When\\r\\nthe sun was about one-half hour high, I took the old shot gun, this\\r\\ntime loaded with genuine buck shot and climbed the Indian ladder to\\r\\nthe scaffold which was built about twenty feet from the ground in a\\r\\nhemlock tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat quiet until sundown and no deer came. I thought I would tie the\\r\\ngun in the notches in the limbs, which brought the gun in proper\\r\\nrange to kill the deer in the lick, should it come after dark. I got\\r\\none string tied around the barrel and the limb when a slight noise to\\r\\nmy left caused me to look in that direction and I saw a dark object\\r\\nstanding in the edge of the little thicket, which I took to be a\\r\\nblack creature I had seen down near the clearing when I came to the\\r\\nlick. My thoughts were that I would tie the breech of the gun fast to\\r\\nthe limb, and then I would climb down and stone the animal away, so I\\r\\nwent on tying the gun fast. On looking up I saw that the supposedly\\r\\nblack heifer had turned out to be a black bear, and that it was going\\r\\nto go above the lick and not into it. My knife was out in an instant\\r\\nand the next moment I had the strings that held the gun cut. I raised\\r\\nit carefully to my face and about this time the bear stopped, turned\\r\\nhis head around and looked back in the direction he had come. This\\r\\nwas my chance, and I fired both barrels at his head and shoulders,\\r\\nand immediately there was a snorting, snarling, rolling and tumbling\\r\\nof the bear, but the maneuvers of the bear was no comparison to the\\r\\nscreams and shouts that came from me. I was still making more noise\\r\\nthan a band of Indians when Mr. Duell arrived on the scene and took\\r\\nin the situation. The other men who were watching other licks thought\\r\\nI had surely been attacked by the wolves by the unearthly yell I was\\r\\nmaking and the whole party were soon on the ground. The bear was soon\\r\\ndressed and the men gave me the cognomen of the \"The Great Hunter of\\r\\nKentucky\" and so ended the killing of my first bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am still in hopes to take the pelts from one or two this fall and\\r\\nwinter and later, I will tell of some of the incidents I have seen\\r\\nand experienced while trapping and hunting among them. Perhaps, how a\\r\\nbrother of mine got a tenderfoot to ride the carcass of a deer down a\\r\\nsteep and hard frozen mountain when there was about two inches of\\r\\nsnow on would be interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy First Real Trapping Experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was about eighteen, I received a letter from a man by the name\\r\\nof Harris, who lived in Steuben County, New York, wherein he stated\\r\\nthat a Mr. Lathrop had suggested me as a suitable party to go with\\r\\nhim to the region known as Black Forest. This section extends through\\r\\nfour counties, the southern part of Potter and Tioga counties, and\\r\\nnorthern part of Clinton and Lycoming counties, Pa. Every reader\\r\\nknows or has heard of the Black Forest region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section was and is still (1910) known as a good bear country. I\\r\\nthought it strange that Mr. Lathrop, a man of much note as a hunter,\\r\\nwould recommend me, merely a boy, to go with Mr. Harris and into a\\r\\nregion like the Black Forest. As Mr. Lathrop lived about four miles\\r\\nfrom our place I lost no time in going there to learn who this Mr.\\r\\nHarris was. I was informed that he was an old hunter and trapper\\r\\nabout eighty years old and that he wanted a partner more for a\\r\\ncompanion than a hunter or trapper. Mr. Lathrop had met Mr. Harris\\r\\nwhile on a fishing tour on the Sinnamahoning waters during the summer\\r\\nand said that he knew nothing of Mr. Harris otherwise than what he\\r\\nsaw of him at this meeting and to all appearances he was a fine old\\r\\ngentleman. I showed the letter to father and asked what I should do\\r\\nabout it and he replied that he thought I could spend my time to a\\r\\nbetter advantage in school, but he did not say that I could not go\\r\\nwith Mr. Harris. I therefore wrote him that I would be ready at the\\r\\ntime mentioned which was the twentieth of October.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Goodsil, the gunsmith in town, had been at work for some time on\\r\\na new gun for me. Now that I was going into the woods to hunt in\\r\\nearnest, I was at the gun shop nearly every day, urging Mr. Goodsil\\r\\nto finish my gun which he did and in plenty of time. After I got my\\r\\ngun the days seemed like weeks and the weeks like months. I was\\r\\nconstantly in fear that Mr. Harris would not come. But promptly at\\r\\nthe time set, in the evening just before sundown, a man with a one\\r\\nhorse wagon loaded with bear traps and other traps of smaller size\\r\\nand with one of the worst old rack-of-bones of a horse that I had\\r\\never seen, drove up to father\\'s place, stopped and inquired if Mr.\\r\\nWoodcock lived there. I immediately asked if he was Mr. Harris, as I\\r\\nhad already guessed who the man was. He replied that he was and said\\r\\nthat he took it that I was the lad who was going with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harris said that \"often an old horse and a colt\" worked well\\r\\ntogether and that we would make a good team. While we were putting\\r\\nhis horses away I asked him what he intended to do with the old horse\\r\\nand he replied that he brought him along so that if we got stuck he\\r\\ncould hitch him on and help out. The other horse was a fine horse and\\r\\nI was at a loss to know what Mr. Harris meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the evening I thought father and Mr. Harris talked on every\\r\\nother subject rather than hunting but I managed to put in a few\\r\\nquestions now and again as to what we were to do when we arrived at\\r\\nthe great Black Forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harris was a tall, broad-shouldered man with a long beard nearly\\r\\nas white as snow. We were up early the next morning and on our way\\r\\nbefore daylight. Our route was over the road known as the Jersey\\r\\nShore turnpike but after the first four miles we went through an\\r\\nunbroken wilderness for twenty miles, save only one house, then known\\r\\nas the Edcomb Place, now called Cherry Springs. The next place, ten\\r\\nmiles farther on, was a group of four or five shacks called Carter\\r\\nCamp, but known now as Newbergen. This was in the year 1863 and the\\r\\nconditions over this road are the same today only the large timber\\r\\nhas been mostly cut away and there is no one living at Cherry\\r\\nSprings. Five miles farther on we came to Oleana, where there was a\\r\\nhotel and store, owned by Henry Anderson, a Norwegian, who came to\\r\\nthis country as the private secretary of Ole Bull, the great\\r\\nviolinist, and it was here where the much talked of Ole Bull Castle\\r\\nwas built.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeg pardon, I guess I am getting off the trap line. We stopped at the\\r\\nhotel for the night and the next morning purchased supplies\\r\\nsufficient to last during the entire campaign, consisting of lard,\\r\\npork, flour, corn meal, tea, coffee, rice, beans, sugar and the\\r\\nnecessary salt, pepper, etc. I remember well when Mr. Harris ordered\\r\\nfifty pounds of beans and asked me if I thought that would do? I\\r\\nreplied that I thought it would. In my mind I wondered what we would\\r\\ndo with all those beans. But now I wish to say to the man going into\\r\\ncamp on a long hunting and trapping campaign, don\\'t forget the beans\\r\\nas they are bread and meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now within about ten or twelve miles of where we intended to\\r\\ncamp, which was at the junction of the Bailey and Nebo Branches of\\r\\nYoung Woman\\'s Creek. It was about the middle of the afternoon of the\\r\\nsecond day we were out and Mr. Harris said that here would be a good\\r\\nplace to build the camp. We got the horses out as soon as we could\\r\\nand Mr. Harris picked out a large rock; one side had a straight,\\r\\nsmooth side and was high and broad enough for one end of the shanty\\r\\nand there was a fine spring close by. Mr. Harris pointed to the rock\\r\\nand said that there we had one end of our camp already as well as a\\r\\ngood start towards the fire place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told me to begin the cutting of logs for the other two sides and\\r\\nthe other end. We cut the logs a suitable size to handle well and\\r\\nabout twelve and fourteen feet long. Mr. Harris did the planning\\r\\nwhile I did the heavy part of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night we slept under a hemlock tree and were up the next morning\\r\\nand had breakfast before daylight and ready for the day\\'s work. We\\r\\ncould see scuds of clouds away off in the southwest which Mr. Harris\\r\\nsaid did not show well for us. He had brought a good crosscut saw and\\r\\nit was not long until we had logs enough cut to put up the sides,\\r\\nabout four feet high and logs for one end. We hauled the logs all up\\r\\nwith the horse so they would be handy. Then we began the work of\\r\\nnotching and putting up the logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout noon a drizzling rain started and kept it up all the afternoon.\\r\\nWe covered our provisions and blankets the best we could to keep them\\r\\ndry and continued to work on the camp. We got the body up, the\\r\\nrafters and a part of the roof on. We put up a ridge roof as Mr.\\r\\nHarris said it would not be necessary to have the sides quite so high\\r\\nwith a steep ridge roof. We got our supplies under shelter and had a\\r\\ndry place to sleep that night. It was still raining in the morning\\r\\nbut we continued to work on the camp like beavers all day and we got\\r\\nshakes split from a pine stub to finish the roof and chinking blocks\\r\\nto chink between the logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Mr. Harris said that he would go and take the horse\\r\\nout to a farm house that was about six miles out the turnpike, known\\r\\nas the Widow Herod Place, or better known as Aunt Bettie. Mr. Harris\\r\\nsaid he would go while there was food enough to last the old horse a\\r\\nday or two until we were ready to use him. Then I knew that the old\\r\\nhorse was doomed to be used for bear bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Harris started away with the horse he cautioned me not to go\\r\\noff hunting, but to stick to work on the shanty which I did like a\\r\\n\"nailer.\" When Mr. Harris returned I had the roof on, the chinking\\r\\nall in and the gable end boarded up with shakes and all ready to\\r\\nbegin calking and mudding. It was some time in the afternoon when he\\r\\ngot back and after looking over the shack to see what I had done he\\r\\nsaid that he thought I had done so well that I was entitled to a play\\r\\nspell and suggested that we take our guns and go down along the side\\r\\nof the hill and see if we could kill a deer, remarking that we could\\r\\nuse a little venison if we had it. He told me to go up onto the bench\\r\\nnear the top of the hill while he would take the lower bench and he\\r\\nwould hunt the side hill along down the stream until dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harris had a single barrel gun with a barrel three or four feet\\r\\nlong which he called Sudden Death, and it weighed twelve or fourteen\\r\\npounds. As for me I had my new double barrel gun which I have\\r\\nmentioned before. We had not gone far until I heard the report of a\\r\\ngun below me and soon I heard Mr. Harris \"ho-ho-hoa,\" and I hurried\\r\\nto where the howling came from and found him already taking the\\r\\nentrails out of a small doe. I suggested to Mr. Harris that we take\\r\\nthe deer down to the creek before we dressed it and that by so doing\\r\\nwe probably could catch a mink or coon with the entrails. He\\r\\nconsented to do so and after we had taken out the entrails Mr. Harris\\r\\nnoticed a fine place to catch a fox or some other animal and pointed\\r\\nto a large tree that had fallen across the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tree had broken in two at the bank, on the side of the stream\\r\\nwhere we were. The water had swung the trunk of the tree down the\\r\\nstream until there was a space of three or four feet between the end\\r\\nof the tree and the bank. Mr. Harris took a part of the offal from\\r\\nthe deer and carried it across to the opposite bank and placed the\\r\\nremainder on the side where we were. He then placed an old limb for a\\r\\ndrag to the trap at the place where he wanted to set the trap. As we\\r\\nhad no traps with us we went to camp and early the next morning we\\r\\ntook two traps and went to this place and set them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe put in that day finishing the camp, putting in the door and fixing\\r\\nthe chimney to the fireplace and calking all the cracks between the\\r\\nlogs and mudded tight between the logs and all the joints. Now the\\r\\ncamp being completed we began setting the bear traps. The old horse\\r\\nwas taken onto a chestnut ridge and shot, cut up into small pieces\\r\\nsuitable for bear bait, and hung up in small saplings such as we\\r\\ncould bend down. After the bait was fastened to the tree we let it\\r\\nspring up so as to keep it out of the reach of any animal until we\\r\\nhad a trap set.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way Mr. Harris set a bear trap was to build a V shaped pen about\\r\\nthree feet long and about the same in height, place the bait in the\\r\\nback end of the pen and set the trap in the entrance. We had eleven\\r\\nbear traps and after they were all set on different ridges where\\r\\nbears were most likely to travel, we began the work of setting the\\r\\nsmall traps which was not a long job, as we had only about forty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Mr. Harris said that I had better go down and see if\\r\\nthe traps we had set had been disturbed and he said that he would\\r\\nrest while I was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came in sight of the traps I could see a fox bounding around\\r\\nin one of the traps. I could see on looking at the trap we had placed\\r\\nacross the creek that the drag had been moved closer to the log but I\\r\\ncould see nothing moving. I cut a stick and killed the fox when I\\r\\ncrossed over to see what was in the other trap and to my disgust\\r\\nthere was a skunk. I was not particularly in love with skunks in\\r\\nthose days, for while they scented just as loud at that time as now\\r\\nthey were vastly lacking in the money value. I took hold of the clog\\r\\nand carefully dragged the skunk to the creek and sank him in the\\r\\nwater. I now went back to the other side of the creek and set the fox\\r\\ntrap and when I had the trap set the skunk was good and dead. I reset\\r\\nthe trap and took the fox and skunk to camp without skinning. When I\\r\\ngot to camp I found Mr. Harris busy making stretching boards of\\r\\ndifferent sizes for different animals from shakes that we had left\\r\\nwhen covering the roof. Mr. Harris laughed and said that he knew that\\r\\nwe would need them when I got back. The fox and skunk were skinned,\\r\\nstretched and hung up on the outside of the gable of the shack, and\\r\\nthat was the starting point of our catch of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe set the most of our small traps along the streams for foxes and\\r\\nmink, taking a few to the ridges to set in likely places to catch a\\r\\nfox, and at thick laurel patches where we were likely to catch a wild\\r\\ncat as there was a bounty of $2 on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the small steel traps were set we began building a line of\\r\\ndeadfalls for marten and fisher. After the deadfalls were built we\\r\\ndivided our time between hunting deer and tending the traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe caught three bears, two fisher, which were very scarce, as I do\\r\\nnot think that fishers were ever very plentiful in this state, a good\\r\\nbunch of marten, foxes, four or five wildcats and killed twenty-two\\r\\ndeer. The last days of December Mr. Harris said that we would prepare\\r\\nto go home as the deer season closed the first of January. Although\\r\\nthe law gave until the fifteenth to get your deer we had dragged the\\r\\nmost of ours up to the Bailey Mill at various times. We got all those\\r\\naround the mill and sent them to Jersey Shore by freight teams to the\\r\\nrailroad, then shipped them to New York. We got 15 cents for saddles\\r\\nand 10 cents for the whole deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harris had brought an auger with him so that he could make a\\r\\nsleigh to go home with and from birch saplings we made one and on the\\r\\nthirteenth of January I went and got the horse. He was as fat as a\\r\\npig and felt like a colt. We hitched him up to the sleigh and got our\\r\\nstuff up to the Bailey Mill where we loaded the wagon onto the sleigh\\r\\nand piled on the furs and the rest of our outfit and early on the\\r\\nmorning of the fourteenth we started for home. This ended my first\\r\\nreal experience as a hunter and trapper.\\r\\n\\r\\nI received two or three letters from Mr. Harris, the last one in\\r\\nwhich he stated that he was not feeling very well and I never heard\\r\\nfrom him again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Early Experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1871 or 1872 I had several bear traps made by our local blacksmith\\r\\nand I started in as a bear trapper and went it alone. After being out\\r\\nwith Mr. Harris I had taken some valuable lessons on trapping bear\\r\\nand other animals. I built a good log camp on the West Branch of Pine\\r\\nCreek and went to trapping and hunting without either partner or\\r\\ncompanion, but after being in camp the first season I bought a\\r\\nshepherd dog that was a year old and broke him for still hunting and\\r\\ntrapping. I found that a good intelligent dog was not only a\\r\\ncompanion but also a valuable one. I have noticed that some trappers\\r\\ndo not want a dog on the trap line with them, claiming that the dog\\r\\nis a nuisance. This is because the dog was not properly trained.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get back to the bear trapping: In the locality where I was\\r\\ntrapping, bear were not very plentiful except in season, when there\\r\\nwas a crop of beechnuts, although there was but little other shack,\\r\\nsuch as chestnuts and acorns. However, some seasons there would be an\\r\\nabundance of black cherries which the bears are very fond of. I set\\r\\nthree traps at the head of a broad basin where there were three or\\r\\nfour springs and the next day I set the balance of my bear traps;\\r\\nthen I built a few deadfalls for coons and set a few steel traps for\\r\\nfox.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had seen several fresh bear tracks crossing the stream, where I\\r\\nhad been setting the coon traps, on the morning of the third day\\r\\nafter I had set the first three bear traps, I thought that I would go\\r\\nand look after them. They were about a mile and a half from camp and\\r\\nwhen I came in sight of the first trap I saw that I had a bear. You\\r\\nmay be sure that I again felt like a mighty hunter. I was more\\r\\npleased over this one bear than I was over the eight bear we had\\r\\ncaught when I was with Mr. Harris, because now I was the trapper and\\r\\nnot Mr. Harris. The bear was a good sized female. She had become fast\\r\\nonly a short distance from where the trap was set. I shot and skinned\\r\\nthe bear then cut the carcass into quarters, bent down a sapling and\\r\\nhung a quarter of the bear on this. With a forked pole I raised the\\r\\nsapling up until the meat was out of the way of small animals that\\r\\nmight happen along.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hanging up three of the quarters in this manner, leaving one to\\r\\ntake to camp, I took the lungs and liver and put them in the bait\\r\\npen. The bait had all been eaten and I was quite sure it had been\\r\\ndone after the bear was caught, as a bear immediately loses its\\r\\nappetite after placing its foot in a good, strong trap. I really\\r\\nexpected to find another bear in one of the other traps as they were\\r\\nnot far away, but the other traps were undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning I thought I would take some bait from camp and bait\\r\\nthe trap where I had put the offals from the bear, fearing that\\r\\nshould a bear come along it might not eat the bait that was in the\\r\\npen. You may imagine my surprise when I came in sight of the trap to\\r\\nsee another bear fast in the trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter killing the bear I removed the entrails and started to carry\\r\\nthe bear to camp. It was a cub and I could carry it without cutting\\r\\nit in parts. I was just about to start for camp when I decided I\\r\\nwould go to the other traps. If I was surprised at seeing the first\\r\\ncub, I was doubly so, for there was another cub tangled up in the\\r\\ntrap. Do you think I felt gay? Well, that was no name for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shot this cub and without waiting to dress it I took a lively gait\\r\\nto the other trap to see if there were any more bears but there was\\r\\nnothing there. The last two bears, I think were the cubs of the old\\r\\nbear that I had caught the night before. I spent the entire day\\r\\ngetting the bears to camp. I did not get any more bear for some time\\r\\nalthough I had an opportunity to learn a whole lot about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days after I got the old bear and the cubs, I found the bait pen\\r\\nin one of the traps torn down by a bear, which had taken the bait and\\r\\nhad not sprung the trap. Right here I will say that I learned a great\\r\\ndeal more about the habits of Bruin. After finding the bait gone I\\r\\nthought that all I would have to do was to make the bait pen a little\\r\\nstronger so Bruin could not tear it down so readily to get at the\\r\\nbait. I did not think that a bear knew anything about \"trapology,\"\\r\\nfor the experience I had so far in bear trapping was that bears knew\\r\\nbut little more about a trap than a hog, though later I found I was\\r\\nvery much mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: SETTING A LARGE STEEL TRAP FOR BEAR.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trap was set in a small brook where there were plenty of rocks of\\r\\nall sizes. I rolled several of these rocks, as large as I could\\r\\nhandle, up about the bait pen to strengthen it to such an extent that\\r\\nBruin would not think of tearing it down. I figured the bear by going\\r\\nover the trap would take the bait from the entrance of the pen as a\\r\\ngood bear should; though in this I was greatly mistaken. The second\\r\\nday I went to the trap with full expectation of finding Bruin fast in\\r\\nthe trap, but again I was disappointed--Bruin had again gone to the\\r\\nback of the pen and torn the top of the pen off, rolling away some of\\r\\nthe stones, taking the bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I saw that if I was to get my friend Bruin, I would have to work\\r\\na little strategy. I removed the trap from the clog, leaving the clog\\r\\nundisturbed and making all appear just the same as it did when the\\r\\ntrap was set. I was very careful to have the covering of the trap\\r\\nleft just the same as when the trap was set. Then I got another clog\\r\\nand set the trap at the back of the pen at the place where the bear\\r\\nhad torn off the top of the bait pen. Here I concealed the trap and\\r\\nclog as completely as I knew how and being very careful to make all\\r\\nappear just as before the trap was set, flattering myself that Bruin\\r\\nwould surely put his foot in it this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went early the next morning, being sure that I would find Bruin,\\r\\nbut no bear had been there. I went again early the next morning with\\r\\nhigh expectations of finding Bruin waiting for me, but again nothing\\r\\nhad been disturbed. Thinking that Bruin had left that locality\\r\\naltogether, or that he would not be back again for several days, I\\r\\nthought I would go and have a team come and take out the furs and\\r\\ngame I had, and give Bruin time to get back after more bait. As I had\\r\\ncaught no bear at the other traps, I felt quite certain that Bruin\\r\\nwas still somewhere in the neighborhood and would be around again\\r\\nafter more bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reached home an old gentleman by the name of Nelson who was a\\r\\nnoted hunter and trapper and who lived near us, came to see me. Let\\r\\nme explain who this Mr. Nelson was, as I shall have more to say of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Nelson was one of the early settlers in this county, moving here\\r\\nat an early date from Washington County, New York State. He was known\\r\\nhere as Uncle Horatio and by many as Squire Nelson, as he was a\\r\\nJustice of the Peace here for thirty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Nelson would always come to our house as soon as he found that I\\r\\nwas at home, to see what luck I had in the way of trapping and\\r\\nhunting. On this occasion, Mr. Nelson, or Uncle Horatio, as we always\\r\\ncalled him, was soon over to learn what luck I had and when I told\\r\\nhim what sort of a time I had trying to outwit the bear, he said I\\r\\nhad better build a deadfall and let the bear kill himself. Uncle said\\r\\nthat Bruin would give me much trouble and was likely to leave and I\\r\\nwould not get him at all. This idea I did not like, for I had, before\\r\\nthis, been put to my wit\\'s end to outwit a cunning old fox, but\\r\\nfinally succeeded in catching him and I thought I could outwit such a\\r\\ndumb thing as a bear. I thought if I could not get the bear in a\\r\\nsteel trap, there would be but little use trying to get him in such a\\r\\nclumsy thing as a deadfall--however, Uncle had trapped bear long\\r\\nbefore I was born and knew what he was talking about.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as I got back to camp I went to the bear trap to relieve\\r\\nBruin of his troubles, but it was not the bear that was in trouble,\\r\\nbut myself, for Bruin had been there and torn out a stone at one side\\r\\nof the pen and had taken the bait. Well, the case was getting\\r\\ndesperate, so I got another trap and set it at the side where the\\r\\nbear took the bait the last time, taking all the pains possible in\\r\\nsetting the trap, but the result was no better than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had made it a habit to hang on a small bait near the bear traps,\\r\\nbelieving that the bear would be attracted by the scent of the bait\\r\\nhanging up from the ground more than it would from the bait in the\\r\\npen. At this trap I had hung up the bait in a bush that extended out\\r\\nfrom the bank over the brook and each time the bear had taken this\\r\\nbait. I now took one of the traps at the pen, leaving the clog and\\r\\nall appearances as though the trap still remained there. Getting\\r\\nanother clog I concealed it under the edge of the bank and set the\\r\\ntrap under the bait that I had hung in the bush. I was certain this\\r\\ntime that I would outwit Bruin, but instead, the bear went onto the\\r\\nbank, pulled the bush around, took the bait and went about his\\r\\nbusiness. Now I was getting pretty excited and began to think of the\\r\\nadvice of Uncle Horatio but I was not willing to give up yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp the brook, fifty or sixty feet from the bait pen, there had fallen\\r\\na small, bushy hemlock tree which stood on the right hand bank of the\\r\\nspring, and the top of the tree reached nearly over to the opposite\\r\\nbank. I had noticed that when the bear had come to the trap he had\\r\\ncome down the brook and went back the same way. The water was shallow\\r\\nin the brook, barely covering the stones and fallen leaves all over\\r\\nthe bed of the brook. Going to the top of the hemlock tree, I saw\\r\\nthat the bear had passed between the top of this tree and the bank of\\r\\nthe brook. Here was a fine place to conceal the trap and I said, \"Old\\r\\nfellow, here I will surely outwit you.\" I took the trap from the bait\\r\\npen and set it in the open space between the top of the tree and\\r\\nconcealing all the very best I could, I again put more bait in the\\r\\nbait pen and hung up more on the bush.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited two days and then went to the traps again, wondering all the\\r\\nway what the result would be. Well, it was the same as before. The\\r\\nbear had gone to the bush on the bank, taken the bait, and had also\\r\\ntaken the bait from the bait pen as usual. Now I thought it quite\\r\\ntime to try Uncle\\'s plan, though I had but little faith in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was several miles to Mr. Haskins\\', the nearest house, but I lost\\r\\nno time in getting there for I was now feeling desperate. Mr. Haskins\\r\\nreadily consented to help me build a deadfall. We cut a beech tree\\r\\nthat was about fourteen inches through, that stood back in thick\\r\\nundergrowth some rods from the bait pen. We cut a portion about four\\r\\nfeet long from the large end of the tree for the bed-piece and\\r\\nplacing it against the small tree for one of the stakes. With levers\\r\\nwe placed the tree on top of the bed-piece and with three other good\\r\\nstakes driven at each side of the logs fastened the tops of the\\r\\nstakes together with withes to strengthen them, we soon had a good,\\r\\nstrong deadfall made, as every boy who is a reader of the H-T-T,\\r\\nknows how to build. We baited the trap and set it, getting done in\\r\\ntime for Mr. Haskins to get home before dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nI again put bait back in the bait pen and on the bush as before and\\r\\npatiently awaited results. The second day I looked after the traps\\r\\nbut there were no signs of bear being about either the deadfall or\\r\\nthe steel traps and I feared that I had frightened Bruin out of the\\r\\ncountry in building the deadfall. I put in three or four days looking\\r\\nafter other traps, thinking but little about the bear that had, so\\r\\nfar, been beyond my skill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three or four days, I again went to the deadfall, wondering and\\r\\nimagining all kinds of things. When I came to the steel traps the\\r\\nbait was still undisturbed and I was now sure that that particular\\r\\nbear was not for me, but when I stepped into the thicket so that I\\r\\ncould see the deadfall, there was Bruin, good and dead. When I looked\\r\\nat the bear I found that he had three toes gone from one foot and\\r\\nthis I thought to be the cause of his being so over-shy of the steel\\r\\ntraps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned a lesson that has since served me more than one good turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later years it was customary for many of my friends to come to my\\r\\ncamp and spend a few days with me. It was of one of these occasions\\r\\nthat I will relate. Two young men, named Benson and Hill, had sent me\\r\\nword that they were coming out to my camp and hunt a few days; also\\r\\nto go with me to my bear traps but added that they did not suppose\\r\\nthat I would get a bear while they were in camp, even if they would\\r\\nstay all winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been drizzling sort of a rain for several days and every old\\r\\nbear hunter knows that dark, lowery weather is the sort bears like to\\r\\ndo their traveling in. I had set the time to go out on a stream known\\r\\nas the Sunken Branch, to look after some fox traps and also two bear\\r\\ntraps that I had in that section the day I got word from Benson and\\r\\nHill that they would be over to camp the next day. I thought I would\\r\\nput off going to look after the traps in that locality until the boys\\r\\ncame over and should I have the luck to find a bear in one of the\\r\\ntraps it would come very acceptable to have the help to get the bear\\r\\nto camp for it was some four or five miles to the farthest trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys came as they said but the next morning after they got there\\r\\nit was raining very hard and they did not want to go out and did not\\r\\nwant me to go until it slacked up. Well, the next morning it was\\r\\nraining hard and the boys were in no better mood to go out than the\\r\\nday before. It had been several days since I had been to the traps,\\r\\nin that direction, and there were some chestnuts in that locality\\r\\nwhere the bear traps were set. The storm had knocked the chestnuts\\r\\nout and it was probable that bears would be in that locality. I told\\r\\nthe boys I did not like to let the traps go any longer without\\r\\nlooking after them and they could stay in camp and I would go to the\\r\\ntraps. When I was about ready to start, Hill said that he would go\\r\\nwith me, notwithstanding the rain, though Benson tried to persuade us\\r\\nnot to go, stating that no bear was fool enough to travel in such a\\r\\nrain and that all we would get would be a good thorough soaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was determined to delay no longer looking at the traps and started\\r\\noff when Hill said, \"Well, I\\'m with you.\" So we took the nearest cut\\r\\npossible to reach the traps. Hill was continually wishing we would\\r\\nfind a bear in one of the traps and that he could shoot it so that he\\r\\ncould joke with Benson.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur route took us along the top of a ridge for about three miles when\\r\\nwe dropped off to the first trap. When we were still half way up the\\r\\nside of the ridge I saw that Hill had got his wish for I could see a\\r\\nbear rolling and tumbling about down in the hollow and knew that it\\r\\nwas fast in the trap. I tried to point it out to Hill but he could\\r\\nnot get his eye on it, so we went farther down the hill when Jim\\r\\n(that was Hill\\'s given name) could see the bear. He said there was no\\r\\nneed of going closer, that he could shoot it from where we were, but\\r\\nI said we must go closer as I did not like to make holes in the body\\r\\nof the skin unnecessarily. We had only taken a few steps farther when\\r\\nJim said we were plenty close, that he could, shoot it from where we\\r\\nwere and that if we should go closer the bear might break out of the\\r\\ntrap and escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all my urging I could not get Hill closer so I told him to be\\r\\nsure that he shot the bear in the head and not in the body. I\\r\\ndiscovered that Hill was very nervous and told him to take all the\\r\\ntime necessary to make a sure shot. When the gun cracked I saw a twig\\r\\nfall that the gun had cut off fully three feet above the bear\\'s head.\\r\\nI urged Hill a few yards closer when he tried again with no better\\r\\nresults than the first shot. After making the third shot Hill said he\\r\\nguessed that I had better shoot the bear as he thought something had\\r\\ngone wrong with the sights on his gun. It was raining hard so I\\r\\nkilled the bear and took the entrails out, set the trap again and\\r\\nleft the bear lying on the ground. As it was a small bear we\\r\\nconcluded to take the bear to camp whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hurried on to the next trap which was about a mile farther down\\r\\nthe stream. When we got to where the trap was set it was gone, but\\r\\nthe way things were torn up we could see that we had a bear this time\\r\\nthat was no small one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear had worked down the stream, first climbing the hill on one\\r\\nside of the stream until it became entangled in a jam of brush or old\\r\\nlogs, then back down the hill and up on the other side until it\\r\\nbecame discouraged, when it would try the other side again. The bear\\r\\nwas continuously getting the clog fast under the roots of trees or\\r\\nagainst old logs when it would gnaw the brush and tear them out by\\r\\nthe roots. It was also noticed where he would rake the bark on the\\r\\ntrees in trying to climb them, in hopes of escaping the drag that was\\r\\nfollowing him. The bear would gnaw and tear old logs to pieces\\r\\nwhenever the clog became fast against them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all very interesting and exciting to Hill and he said he\\r\\nwould give Benson the laugh when we got to camp. Hill had made me\\r\\npromise not to tell Benson how he had shot three times at the bear\\'s\\r\\nhead and missed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear had worked his way down the stream nearly a mile from where\\r\\nthe trap was set, when we came upon him and shot him at once. Hill\\r\\ndeclaring that it was getting too near night and raining too hard for\\r\\nhim to practice on shooting bear any more that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe skinned the bear, hung up the meat, took the trap and skin and\\r\\nwent back up the creek and set the trap in the same place again.\\r\\nTaking the bear skin we started back to where we left the other bear.\\r\\nAfter carrying the whole bear and bear skin until it was dark, we\\r\\nhung the bear skin up in the crotch of a tree, taking the bear and\\r\\nhurrying to camp at as lively a gait as we were able to make.\\r\\n\\r\\nHill said that while we had had a pretty rough day of it he would\\r\\nmake it all up in getting the joke on Benson if I would not give him\\r\\naway on shooting the bears, as Hill was to tell Benson all about how\\r\\nhe did it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we came to camp I said to Hill that if he cared to we would\\r\\nplay a joke on Benson. He wished to know what the plan was. I said\\r\\nthat we would fix the bear up in the path that led from the shack to\\r\\nthe spring and get Benson to go after a pail of water and run onto\\r\\nthe bear. So we planned to have Benson think that we got no bear and\\r\\nafter supper was over I was to take the pail and start to the spring\\r\\nafter a pail of fresh water when Hill was to interfere and insist\\r\\nthat Benson should go for the water as he had been in camp all day\\r\\nand needed exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about a hundred feet from the shack to the spring and down\\r\\nquite a steep bank and about half way from the shack to the spring\\r\\nwas a beech log across the path. When we got near camp we made no\\r\\nnoise and when we came to the spring we washed our hands carefully to\\r\\nremove any blood that might be on them. Then we took the bear to the\\r\\nlog that was across the path and placed the forepaws and shoulders up\\r\\nover the log leaving the hind parts on the ground, then with a small\\r\\ncrotched stick placed under the bear\\'s throat to hold up its head we\\r\\nhad it fixed up to look as natural as we were able to in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went into the shack looking as downcast as a motherless colt. It\\r\\nwas unnecessary to deny getting any bear for Benson told us almost\\r\\nbefore we were inside that we should have known that we would get no\\r\\nbear in any such weather as we were having and none but simpletons\\r\\nwould have gone out in such rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ate our supper which Benson had waiting for us. We had little to\\r\\nsay farther than to talk of what a fearful rain we were having. After\\r\\nsupper was over I took the water pail, though it was nearly full of\\r\\nwater, and threw the water out the door before Benson had time to\\r\\nobject, saying that I would get a pail of fresh water. Hill said that\\r\\nwe should let Benson go after the water as he had not been out of the\\r\\nshanty all day and needed some fresh air. Benson consented to go\\r\\nafter another pail of water although he said that he had brought the\\r\\nwater that we had thrown out just before we came. I told Benson that\\r\\nI would hold the light at the door so he could see but Benson replied\\r\\nthat I need not bother, all that was necessary was to leave the door\\r\\nof the shack open so that he could see his way back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the time that Benson reached the log he gave a terrible howl\\r\\nand we heard the water pail go rattling through the brush and when we\\r\\ngot to the door Benson was coming on all fours, scrambling as fast as\\r\\nhe could and yelling \"Bah--bah--bear--bear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHill nor I could not keep from roaring with laughter, and finally\\r\\nHill managed to say, \"Oh, you didn\\'t see any bear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBenson made no reply but was as white as a sheet and shook as though\\r\\nhe had the ague. We could not conceal our feelings and when Benson\\r\\nfound his speech he said, \"You think you are mighty cunning; if you\\r\\ngot a bear why didn\\'t you say so and not act like two dumb idiots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had laughed so hard that Benson caught on and the game was up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after Benson was onto our joke, nothing would do but we must\\r\\nget the bear in and skin out the fore parts so we could have some\\r\\nbear meat cooked before we went to bed. Every time Hill awoke during\\r\\nthe night he would burst out laughing while Benson would hurl a few\\r\\ncuss words at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we brought in the skin and saddles of the other bear,\\r\\nleaving the fore quarters for fox and marten bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rain now being about over with and the ground and leaves\\r\\nthoroughly soaked, it was a good time for still hunting deer, so we\\r\\nwere all out early the next morning. We started out together and soon\\r\\nbecame separated and it so happened that I was the only one to get a\\r\\ndeer during the day. When I got to camp I found Benson was not in\\r\\nyet, so I did not tell that I had killed a deer, but thought I would\\r\\nwait until Benson came in and see what luck he had. If he had not\\r\\nkilled anything I would give him the hint and let him have the credit\\r\\nof killing the deer that I got as a sort of off-set on Hill on the\\r\\nbear hunt. I stayed outside gathering dry limbs for wood until I saw\\r\\nBenson coming and I planned to meet him before Hill got to talk to\\r\\nhim. I learned that Benson had not killed anything, so I told him\\r\\nwhere I had killed the deer and that if he cared to he could claim\\r\\nthe deer as his game. Benson was much pleased with the idea and as I\\r\\nhad told him just where I had killed the deer it was easy for Benson\\r\\nto explain to Hill where the deer was shot. Hill did not believe that\\r\\nBenson had killed a deer and said he would not believe he (Benson)\\r\\nhad killed one if he did not know that he had been alone and anyway\\r\\nhe must see the deer before he would believe it. I took the first\\r\\nopportunity when Hill was out to tell Benson which way to go so that\\r\\nhe would be sure to find the deer and the next morning the boys went\\r\\nout and brought in the deer while I went to look after some traps.\\r\\nThe boys stayed a day or two longer and then went home declaring that\\r\\nthey had had the best hunt of their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now tell of some of my hunting and trapping with Mr. Nelson\\r\\nand my first experience with a big cat. About 1860, when I was a mere\\r\\nchunk of a boy, a man by the name of Perry Holman was camping on the\\r\\nextreme headwaters of Pine Creek, hunting and trapping. Early one\\r\\nmorning Mr. Holman came out of the woods after groceries and other\\r\\nnecessaries. On his way out he saw where a small bear had crossed the\\r\\nroad just at the top of the hill on the old Jersey Shore turnpike and\\r\\nabout five miles from Mr. Nelson\\'s place. Mr. Nelson at that time\\r\\nalways kept one or two good bear dogs. Mr. Holman told Mr. Nelson of\\r\\nthe bear\\'s track and said that the bear had gone into a laurel patch\\r\\non the west side of the road and that the track was very fresh. He\\r\\nthought if Mr. Nelson would take his dogs and go out that he could\\r\\nget the bear without much trouble as he believed the bear would still\\r\\nbe in the laurels close to the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Nelson told Mr. Holman to get his groceries while he would come\\r\\nto see if I would go along to look after the team while Mr. Nelson\\r\\nand Mr. Holman went into the laurels after the bear. Of course, I was\\r\\nready for anything that had hunt in it. The sleighing was good and\\r\\nMr. Nelson was soon ready, taking his dogs into the sleigh so that\\r\\nthey would not break off on the track of a deer or some other animal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came to where Mr. Holman saw the bear or cub, Mr. Nelson, or\\r\\nUncle as we always called him, said to Mr. Holman before he got out\\r\\nof the sleigh:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perry, that is no cub\\'s track; that is a big cat and I think we will\\r\\nfind him in the laurel patch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle told me to stay with the team and that they would not be gone\\r\\nlong; that if the track led off he would come back to the sleigh and\\r\\nI could go back with the team and he would go to Mr. Holman\\'s camp\\r\\nand stay over night and come home the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs were anxious to take the trail, but Uncle held them in to\\r\\nthe laurels. They had not been gone more than ten minutes when the\\r\\ndogs began to give tongue like mischief. I could see that the dogs\\r\\nwere coming towards the road and in about a minute saw the biggest\\r\\ncat that I had ever seen at that time, shinning up a large tree that\\r\\nwas not further than fifty yards from the sleigh. The dogs were soon\\r\\nat the tree barking their best and in a few minutes I heard the crack\\r\\nof a gun and the big cat seemed to fly out into the air. I could hear\\r\\nthe cat go threshing down through the limbs on the trees and the dogs\\r\\ndoubled their howling and I could hear the men laugh. I called to the\\r\\nmen to see if they got the cat. Uncle told me to watch the horses and\\r\\nthey would soon be there, and they were soon in sight dragging a\\r\\nlarge panther instead of either a cub or cat. Uncle drove down to\\r\\nwhere Holman\\'s path left the road to go down to his camp and we then\\r\\ndrove back home. Uncle was greatly pleased over Perry\\'s cat hunt as\\r\\nMr. Nelson called it.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn or about the year \\'67 or \\'68, Uncle Horatio Nelson, whom I have\\r\\nspoken of before, had for years been accustomed to going to Edgecomb\\r\\nPlace, later known as Cherry Springs, to hunt and trap. Wolves were\\r\\nthen more plentiful than foxes are at the present time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will explain that Cherry Springs was simply a farm house built of\\r\\nlogs. This house was located about half way through, or in the center\\r\\nof a dense forest of about twenty miles square. The Jersey Shore\\r\\nturnpike ran through this vast forest and the stage or any traveler\\r\\ngoing through this region were obliged to stop at this house to feed\\r\\nat noon, or to stop over night, this being the only house on the\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom where this house was located there was easy access to the waters\\r\\nof Pine Creek, which flowed east, to the waters of the Cross Fork of\\r\\nKettle Creek, which flowed south and to the waters of the East Fork\\r\\nof the Sinnamahoning which flowed west. There was no one living on\\r\\nany of these streams for many miles. This was the point where Mr.\\r\\nNelson, or Uncle, as I shall call him, hunted for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time I am writing of, it had been a noted place for many\\r\\nhunters to stop from all parts of the country. There were almost too\\r\\nmany hunters stopping at Cherry Spring to suit Uncle as he was\\r\\ngetting pretty well along in years and did not like so much company.\\r\\nI had been camping a greater part of the time for several seasons\\r\\nabout five miles north of Cherry Springs and one day Uncle said, if I\\r\\ncared to, he would go on to Crossfork and build a cabin and we would\\r\\nhunt and trap, more particularly trap. This was satisfactory to me\\r\\nalthough I had a good camp where I was trapping and in a fairly good\\r\\nlocality for game, but the Crossfork country was a little farther in\\r\\nthe tall timber so I thought that the change might be a good thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the first of October we took a team, went into the woods and\\r\\ncut out a sort of a turkey trail from the wagon road down to Boon\\r\\nRoad Hollow to the Hog\\'s Back branch of the Crossfork, where we\\r\\nselected a sight for the camp. We felled a large hemlock tree and cut\\r\\noff four logs of suitable length to make the body of the camp about\\r\\nten by twelve feet inside. We worked them around in shape fitting the\\r\\ntwo shorter logs in between the ends of the two longer logs; then\\r\\nplacing rafters at about half pitch, put on the covering, chinked and\\r\\ncalked all the cracks and built a chimney of stones, sticks and clay\\r\\nand put in a door.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now ready for the trap line. We set the bear traps on\\r\\ndifferent ridges where we thought would be the most likely places for\\r\\nbears to travel. Then we put out two lines of deadfalls for marten.\\r\\nWe then took the different branches and spring runs, building more\\r\\ndeadfalls for mink and coons, setting the greater part of our steel\\r\\ntraps for foxes. After all the steel traps but three or four were\\r\\nset, Uncle said that if I would go down the creek and set the balance\\r\\nof the steel traps, he would go and look after the first of the bear\\r\\ntraps that we had set. I set the steel traps for foxes and built one\\r\\nor two more deadfalls farther down the creek. I think that I found a\\r\\nmink and one coon in the deadfalls that we had set in that section.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got to camp about dark but Uncle had not come yet. I hustled supper\\r\\nto have it ready when he came, but when supper was ready I could\\r\\nneither see nor hear anything of him. After waiting some time I\\r\\nconcluded to eat and then if he did not come I would go in the\\r\\ndirection he had taken as I now suspected that he had gotten a bear\\r\\nand was bringing in what he could carry and that I would meet him and\\r\\nhelp him in with his load. Before I started out to see if I could\\r\\nfind him I gave several long and loud \"coohoopes,\" but got no answer.\\r\\nI concluded I would fire a couple of gunshots and see if I could get\\r\\nan answer, but got no reply save the hoot of an owl.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now began to feel alarmed, fearing that some misfortune had\\r\\nhappened Uncle as he knew every rod of the ground in that section. I\\r\\nhad no lantern so I made two good torches from fat pine, having a\\r\\ngood supply in camp, and followed the stream until I came to a little\\r\\ndraw where we had a bear trap set. This trap had not been disturbed,\\r\\nso I climbed the hill to the top of the ridge when I fired two more\\r\\ngunshots but still got no response. I was now thoroughly alarmed as I\\r\\nknew that a gunshot on the still night air could be heard a long ways\\r\\nfrom the high ridge I was on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the aid of another torch I hurried on to the next bear trap and\\r\\nupon arriving at the second trap I saw that the clog was gone and\\r\\nthat there was a trail leading off through the leaves and\\r\\nundergrowth. I now knew that it was something in connection with the\\r\\nbear that was detaining Uncle, but what it was I could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed the trail with the aid of the torch for fifty yards when I\\r\\ncame to a fallen tree that lay up about a foot from the ground. Here\\r\\nI found the clog that had been fastened to the trap. I could see that\\r\\nthe trap ring had been moved from the clog by the aid of a hatchet. I\\r\\nsearched about but could find no signs of the trap nor of the bear\\r\\nand I could no longer follow the trail by the aid of the torch, the\\r\\nlast one being now pretty well burned out. There was nothing for me\\r\\nto do but go back to camp and wait until morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was within a mile or less of camp, I heard the report of a gun\\r\\nin the direction of camp and knew that Uncle had arrived and was\\r\\nfiring his gun to let me know that he was in camp. I answered the\\r\\ncall by firing my gun and hurried on to camp to see what had detained\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear had gone over the fallen tree while the end of the clog had\\r\\ncaught under the log and a weak link in the trap chain had given\\r\\naway, Bruin going off with the trap. Uncle had followed the bear\\r\\nseveral miles when dark came on. He followed down the stream to where\\r\\nit came in to the branch that the camp was on, and being over a ridge\\r\\nand so far from the camp was the cause of him not hearing the\\r\\ngunshots that I had fired. Uncle followed the bear until dark so as\\r\\nto know about where he was in case a snow should fall to fill up the\\r\\ntrail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after midnight when we turned in but we were up in good season\\r\\nthe next morning and taking a lunch in our knapsacks and each a\\r\\nblanket, we started for the wind jam to see if we could find the\\r\\nbear. Uncle took me to the bear\\'s trail at the edge of the wind jam\\r\\nwhere I waited, giving him time to get around on the opposite side of\\r\\nthe jam, at a point, where the bear was likely to come out, provided\\r\\nI should start him. I had not followed the trail far into the jam\\r\\nbefore I came to where the bear had made a bed by breaking down\\r\\nbriers and gnawing down saplings, but he did not stay long at this\\r\\nplace when he again went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon came to another such bed and after finding several more, came\\r\\nto one that was fresher than the others. I could see that the bed had\\r\\nbeen made during the night. I now began to work my way along the\\r\\ntrail very cautiously with my gun in hand ready for action and my\\r\\nheart in my mouth for I knew that Bruin would soon be on the move. I\\r\\nworked my way through the jam at a snail\\'s pace and soon heard the\\r\\nrattle of the trap and could see the brush move not more than a\\r\\nhundred feet away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undergrowth was so thick that I could get no distinct sight of\\r\\nthe bear but fired a shot more to let Uncle know that Bruin was on\\r\\nthe move than of any expectation of hitting him. When the gun cracked\\r\\nthe bear gave a snort like that of a frightened hog and I could hear\\r\\nhim tearing through the brush at a great rate. It was not long until\\r\\nI heard Uncle shoot and in the course of two or three minutes I heard\\r\\nhim shoot again and knew that Bruin had given up the trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had gone along the trail quite a ways, I saw a few drops of\\r\\nblood now and then and when I reached Uncle he was already skinning\\r\\nthe bear. We found three holes in the bear. Uncle\\'s second shot which\\r\\nwas the finishing shot, hit the bear in the head. The shot that I\\r\\nfired caught Bruin just forward of the hips and undoubtedly would\\r\\nhave killed him in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe skinned the bear and took the hind quarters, the skin and trap and\\r\\nstarted for camp. I must say that I think this was the hardest stunt\\r\\nof packing that I remember and every old trapper knows what sort of a\\r\\njob of toting he often runs up against. We went down the run about\\r\\ntwo miles before coming to the stream that our camp was on, and then\\r\\nwe had to go up this stream about four miles to camp. When we reached\\r\\nthe stream it was dark; there was no path and there was a great deal\\r\\nof fallen timber and undergrowth along the creek, the creek winding\\r\\naround from one side of the valley to the other. It was a continual\\r\\nfording of the creek, climbing over fallen timber, through\\r\\nundergrowth and what not. You know no one but a trapper would be\\r\\nsilly enough to do such a stunt in the dark. We arrived at camp about\\r\\n9 o\\'clock, wet, tired and hungry. The next morning Uncle was still a\\r\\nlittle sore but I was as good as new and ready for another job of the\\r\\nsame kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days later we had a fall of snow of several inches and the\\r\\nsecond or third day after the snow came we heard a number of gunshots\\r\\nsouth of the camp on the ridge in the direction that we had a bear\\r\\ntrap set. It was near sundown and as we were not aware that there was\\r\\nanyone camping or living in the direction of the gunshots, we\\r\\nconcluded it was hunters shooting at deer. The shots were at such\\r\\nlong intervals that Uncle said he did not think it was anyone\\r\\nshooting at deer and that the shots sounded like they were right\\r\\nwhere we had a bear trap set and that he thought hunters had run onto\\r\\na bear in our trap and were shooting at it. It was then too late to\\r\\ngo to the trap. Uncle said we would get up early in the morning for\\r\\nhe was sure the gunshots were close in the neighborhood in which our\\r\\ntrap was set, and he thought it likely that we had a bear in the\\r\\ntrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were on the way before it was fairly daylight but when we came to\\r\\nthe place where the trap had been set we found it gone. We followed\\r\\nthe trail a short distance when the tracks of three men came onto the\\r\\ntrail. The men had stamped and tracked about where they came onto the\\r\\ntrail as though they were holding a council and then all started off\\r\\non the trail of the bear. They did not go far before they came up\\r\\nwith the bear where the trap clog had become fast between two\\r\\nsaplings. The trap was nowhere to be seen. The men had made many\\r\\ntracks where they killed the bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle said it looked as though the men intended to steal the bear\\r\\ntrap and all. We saw where the track of a man led off towards a large\\r\\nlog and returned. Uncle told me to follow that man\\'s tracks and see\\r\\nwhat he went out there for, as probably he hid the trap behind the\\r\\nlog. I found the trap clog behind the log but there was no trap. It\\r\\nwas snowing some at the time the men killed the bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we found that the men had taken the trap and hid the trap clog\\r\\nUncle exclaimed, \"The varmints intend to steal our bear.\" We followed\\r\\nthe trail of the men as fast as we could for we were quite sure they\\r\\nmust have stopped over night not far from there for it was nearly\\r\\ndark when they killed the bear. Their trail led down the hillside to\\r\\nthe main stream, then down the creek and we hustled after them as\\r\\nfast as we could go. After going down the creek a mile or more we saw\\r\\na smoke and Uncle said, \"There the varmints are,\" and he was right.\\r\\nWe were none too soon as the men were already hitching the horses to\\r\\nthe sleigh ready to start off. We could see that the bear was already\\r\\non the sleigh, although it was covered over with a blanket. The men\\r\\nstarted at us but did not say a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle walked up to the end of the sleigh, caught a corner of the\\r\\nblanket, threw it back and uncovered the bear. Then taking the bear\\r\\nby the foreleg he gave it a flop onto the ground saying, \"You have a\\r\\nbear, haven\\'t you,\" and the bear rolled to the ground and uncovered\\r\\nthe trap; Uncle said, \"You have a trap, too, haven\\'t you.\" Not a word\\r\\ndid any of the men say and when Uncle asked them who they were and\\r\\nwhere they lived, one of them said that they did not intend to steal\\r\\nthe bear but were going to take it to the first house and leave it\\r\\nfor us.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle told them that we did not care to have the bear go in that\\r\\ndirection and told the men they must take the bear to our camp and\\r\\ntheir intentions were to steal the bear and trap and that they had\\r\\nbetter settle the matter at once. The men were ready to settle and\\r\\nasked what it would cost and Uncle told them if they would take the\\r\\nbear to our camp and then leave the woods and not be caught in that\\r\\nsection again, that he would let them go. This they readily consented\\r\\nto do and insisted that we take a part of a cheese they had brought\\r\\nin with them. Uncle told them that we did not care for their cheese\\r\\nor anything else they had--all that we wanted was that they take the\\r\\nbear to our camp and get out of the woods. This they did and one of\\r\\nthem also took the cheese along and left it at the camp. Then they\\r\\nleft, begging that we would not say anything farther about the\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe learned that the men did not live down the creek but instead lived\\r\\nin New York State. They had come for a few days\\' deer hunting and had\\r\\nonly made a shelter of hemlock boughs. The first day out they ran\\r\\nacross the bear and as it was snowing they thought it would snow\\r\\nenough to cover up their tracks and they would take the bear and get\\r\\nback to New York State. Well, they did get back but it happened they\\r\\nleft the bear behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to ask the old liners who have grown too old on the\\r\\ntrail and trap line to follow it longer with profit and pleasure, if\\r\\nthey keep bees? I find it a great pleasure to watch these little,\\r\\nindustrious and intelligent fellows work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Early Experiences (Concluded.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI will state that I began my career as a trapper and hunter at a very\\r\\nearly age. The woods extended to the very door of my father\\'s house\\r\\nand deer were more numerous than sheep in the fields at the present\\r\\nday. Bear were also quite plentiful and wolves were to be found in\\r\\nconsiderable numbers in certain localities. Panthers were much talked\\r\\nof and occasionally one would be killed by some hunter or trapper of\\r\\nwhich I will speak later.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I found my way further up the stream into the\\r\\nwoods where mink and coon tracks were in real paths, and here was\\r\\nwhere father taught me how to make the deadfall, which was the trap\\r\\nprincipally used in those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guns that father had were one double barrel shotgun and a single\\r\\nbarrel rifle, both flintlocks, and with much anxiety I watched those\\r\\nguns and begged of the older members of the family to let me shoot\\r\\nthe gun but mother was ever on the watch to see that I was not\\r\\nallowed to handle the guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time a man moved into the place by the name of Abbott from\\r\\nSchuylkill County, Pa., who brought two guns with him, a double\\r\\nbarrel shotgun and a double barrel rifle. After doing some hard\\r\\nbegging Mr. Abbott said that I could take the shotgun but that he\\r\\ncould not furnish the ammunition. I later thought that Mr. Abbott\\r\\nthought that the problem of getting ammunition would put me up the\\r\\ntree. But again the will was good and I soon found a way. I began to\\r\\nwatch the hen\\'s nests pretty close and hide away the eggs and mother\\r\\nbegan to complain that the hens were not laying as many eggs as\\r\\nusual. Well, three dozen of eggs would get a pound of shot, a fourth\\r\\nof a pound of powder and a box of G. D. gun caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had some fine times out with the gun and I always gave Mr. Abbott\\r\\nwhatever game I killed. I did not dare to take it home fearing that I\\r\\nwould be compelled to explain how I came by the game. One day I had\\r\\nbeen out after wild pigeons and had got quite a number or more than I\\r\\nliked to give away and go without ourselves. I thought I would resort\\r\\nto one of those white lies that we have all heard tell of. I told my\\r\\nparents that Mr. Abbott gave me the pigeons but the plan did not\\r\\nwork, although it was the making of me so far as a gun is concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen father inquired of Mr. Abbott as to how I got the pigeons it\\r\\nbrought out the whole thing as to the gun business and also why the\\r\\negg basket had not filled up as usual. The result was that father and\\r\\nmother held a council of war and decided that if I was to have a gun\\r\\nthe better way was to let me have one of my own. Father told me that\\r\\nI must not borrow a gun any more but take one of our own guns and\\r\\nthat he (father) would take the gun to the gunsmith and have the\\r\\nlocks changed from a flint lock to a cap lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be sure that this was the best news that this kid ever heard.\\r\\nI picked up double the usual stone piles that day and went and got\\r\\nthe cows without being told a half dozen times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, as every hunter and trapper who is born and not made is always\\r\\nlooking for taller timber and trying to get farther and farther from\\r\\nthe ting-tong of the cow bells, so it was in my case. I had seen some\\r\\nwhelp wolves that friends of ours (Harris and Leroy Lyman, who were\\r\\nnoted hunters) had got. They had gone onto the waters of the\\r\\nSinnemahoning and taken five pup wolves not much larger than kittens,\\r\\nfrom their den. The puppies were brought out alive but they killed\\r\\nthe old mother wolf. On their way home they stopped at our house so\\r\\nthat we could see the young wolves.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard these hunters tell how they discovered the wolf den; how they\\r\\nhad howled in imitation of a wolf to call the old wolves up; how they\\r\\nhad shot the old female and had then taken the young wolves from the\\r\\nden; heard them tell of the money that the bounty on wolves would\\r\\nbring them (there was $25 bounty on all wolves then, the same as\\r\\nnow). All of this made me long for the day when I would be old enough\\r\\nto do as these noted hunters had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had already found a den of young foxes and had kept five of them\\r\\nalive, which father finally killed all but one because he said they\\r\\nwere a nuisance. I had seen some Indians bring a live elk in with\\r\\nropes, dogs and horses, which they had roped in, after the dogs had\\r\\nbrought it to bay, on a large rock on Tombs Run (Waters of Pine\\r\\nCreek).\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this made me hungry for the day that I too could hit the trail\\r\\nand trap line that I might get some of those wolves and with the\\r\\nbounty money buy traps and guns to my satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of persons at our place (Lymansville) had gone several miles\\r\\ninto the woods to the headwaters of the Sinnamahoning and taken up\\r\\nfifty acres of land. An acre or two was cleared off and the timber\\r\\nfrom this clearing was drawn and put in an immense pile to be used\\r\\nfor the camp fire. The camp was simply a shed or leanto, open on one\\r\\nside, and in front of this shed the fire was built of beech and maple\\r\\nlogs. Brook trout and game of all kinds were in abundance. Two or\\r\\nthree times during the summer a party of six or eight persons would\\r\\ngo out to this clearing and camp a week, killing as many deer as they\\r\\ncould make use of, jerking a good portion to take home with them and\\r\\nhaving a general good time feasting on trout, venison and other game,\\r\\nand amusing themselves shooting at marks, pitching quoits, etc. I\\r\\nwill add that the main reason they went to this camp was for a good\\r\\ntime rather than the game, as game was plentiful right at their homes\\r\\nin those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, it was at one of these outings that I killed my first bear. I\\r\\nwas about thirteen years old, and, of course, in my own mind, it made\\r\\na mighty hunter of me, not to be compared with Esau of old. It was in\\r\\nJune and shortly after we got to camp there was a heavy thunder\\r\\nstorm, but it all passed over before sundown, the sun coming out nice\\r\\nand bright. I was determined to go with some of the men to watch a\\r\\nlick (there were three or four licks not far away), but none of the\\r\\nmen cared to have my company, and they said it was likely to rain\\r\\nagain and made many excuses why I should not go to watch a lick with\\r\\nthem. Just before they were ready to start out to the lick we heard a\\r\\nwolf howl away off on the hills and they (the men) put up the wolf\\r\\nscare on me and said that there would be no deer come to the lick so\\r\\nlong as wolves were in the neighborhood. I took their stories all in\\r\\nbut insisted that I would watch a lick all the same. There was a lick\\r\\nonly a few hundred yards from camp, but for some cause deer rarely\\r\\never worked it. When they saw that I was going to watch a lick in\\r\\nspite of thunder storms, wolves or all the rest of the excuses that\\r\\nthey could make, they finally said that I could watch the lick which\\r\\nI have mentioned and get eaten up by wolves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a blazed line from camp to the lick and when the men\\r\\nstarted for the licks that each one had decided on watching, I\\r\\nstarted to the lick that was given me to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one man left in camp to watch the horses and to keep camp.\\r\\nThis man said that when he heard me shoot he would come up and help\\r\\nme bring in the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blind at the lick was a scaffold built up in a tree twenty or\\r\\nthirty feet from the ground. I climbed to the scaffold and placed the\\r\\nold gun in the loops that were fastened to limbs on the tree to give\\r\\nthe gun the proper range to kill the deer, should one come to the\\r\\nlick after it was too dark to see to shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing came round the lick before dark, but as soon as it got dark I\\r\\ncould hear animals walking and jumping on all sides of me and one old\\r\\ninquisitive porcupine came up the tree to see what I was doing. He\\r\\nperched himself on a limb not more than two feet from my face and sat\\r\\nthere and chattered his teeth until I could stand it no longer. I\\r\\ntook the large powder horn that I had strung over my shoulder with a\\r\\ncord and gave the porcupine a rap on the nose that sent him tumbling\\r\\ndown the tree. I remember well how other animals scampered from under\\r\\nthe tree when the porcupine tumbled down. At that time I wondered\\r\\nwhat it all was, but later I learned that all these animals were only\\r\\nflying squirrels, rabbits and porcupines, but I imagined that the\\r\\nnoises were made by anything but squirrels and rabbits.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, about eleven o\\'clock I heard something coming towards the lick\\r\\nwith a steady tread like that of a man and again I was taken with a\\r\\nchill that caused the scaffold to shake, but the chill only lasted\\r\\nfor a moment. Soon I heard the animal step in the soft mud and\\r\\ndirectly it began to suck the salt from the dirt and I was sure that\\r\\nit was a deer and that it was the right time to pull the trigger,\\r\\nwhich I did. When the report of the gun died away all that I could\\r\\nhear were the same noises that were made when I knocked the old\\r\\nporcupine from the tree. I now feared that I had pulled the gun on\\r\\nsome other animal rather than a deer. I thought the report of the gun\\r\\nwould frighten all the deer in the woods, so that no deer would go to\\r\\nthe licks the men were watching. I was afraid I would get a terrible\\r\\nscolding by the men who were watching the other licks when they came\\r\\nto camp in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting some time and hearing no noise of any kind, I concluded\\r\\nto get down and go to camp. Upon getting down from the tree I decided\\r\\nthat I would go and look in the lick and see if I could tell what it\\r\\nwas that I had heard there and had shot at. As it was so dark that I\\r\\ncould not see from the blind, you can imagine my surprise when I got\\r\\nto the lick to see a large buck deer lying broadside as dead as could\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI immediately lost all fear of being scolded by the other men, so I\\r\\nclaimed first blood. I began calling for the man who remained in camp\\r\\nbut could get no answer from him so I went down to camp and found him\\r\\nfast asleep. I awakened him and we immediately made a torch and went\\r\\nto the lick and dragged the deer to camp. Then we took out the\\r\\nentrails and bunked down for the rest of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing that I knew, one of the men who had watched a lick not\\r\\nfar away was kicking me and saying, \"Get out of this, you old deer\\r\\nslayer, you, and get some venison frying for breakfast.\" We were soon\\r\\nup for the sun was shining brightly and more than an hour high. Soon\\r\\nthe other watchers came in and reported that not a sound of a deer\\r\\nhad they heard about their licks. Two or three of us (I say \"us\"\\r\\nbecause I was now counted as one of them) went to catch trout for\\r\\nbreakfast, while the others were at work taking care of the venison\\r\\nand preparing breakfast, boiling coffee, frying venison and trout.\\r\\nAnd so the day was spent, sleeping, cocking and eating until it was\\r\\nagain time to go to the licks, as the men wished to get another deer\\r\\nso as to have plenty of venison to take home with them. When the men\\r\\nwere about ready to start to their watching places, one of them\\r\\ninquired of me what I would do as there was no further use of\\r\\nwatching the lick where I had killed the deer, as it was blooded from\\r\\nthe deer I had killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who had watched the lick nearest the camp, and quite an old\\r\\nman, said that I could watch the lick that he had watched and he\\r\\nwould stay in camp. (The men now acknowledged me as a thoroughbred\\r\\nhunter, you see.) Well, I was getting there pretty lively, I thought,\\r\\nwhen an old hunter would give up his lick to me, when only the\\r\\nevening before none of the men thought that I was up to watching a\\r\\nlick at any price.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was pleased to again have a place to watch. Taking some punk wood\\r\\nto make a little smoke to keep off the gnats and mosquitoes, I\\r\\nstarted for the lick and climbed the Indian ladder to the scaffold,\\r\\nbuilt in a hemlock tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had barely got fixed in shape to begin to watch when I chanced to\\r\\nlook towards a small ravine that came down from the hill a few yards\\r\\nto my left and saw what I took to be a black yearling steer. I will\\r\\nadd that the woods in that locality were covered with a rank growth\\r\\nof nettles, cow cabbage and other wood\\'s feed, and people would drive\\r\\ntheir young cattle off into that locality to run during the summer. I\\r\\nthought I would get down from the scaffold and throw stones at it and\\r\\ndrive it off lest it might come into the lick after dark and I might\\r\\ntake it for a deer and shoot it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I started to climb down I again looked in the direction of the\\r\\nsteer, and this time I saw what I thought was the largest bear that\\r\\never traveled the woods. He had left the ravine and was walking with\\r\\nhis head down, going up the hill and past the lick. I cocked both\\r\\nbarrels of the gun and raised it carefully to my shoulder, and,\\r\\nbreaking a little dry twig I had in my hand caused the bear to stop\\r\\nand turn his head around so as to look down the hill. This was my\\r\\ntime so I leveled on his head and shoulders and let go both barrels\\r\\nof the gun at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear went into the air and then began tumbling and rolling down\\r\\nthe hill towards the tree that I was in, bawling and snorting like\\r\\nmad. But if the bear made a howl from pain he was in, it was no\\r\\ncomparison to the howl that I made for help and it did not cease\\r\\nuntil the men in camp came on the run thinking that I had\\r\\naccidentally shot myself. Well, this was my first bear and it was the\\r\\ngreatest day of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the bear to camp, skinned and dressed it and then went to\\r\\nbunk for the night, but it was very little I slept for I could only\\r\\nthink what a mighty hunter I was (in my mind).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men came in in the morning with no better luck than they had the\\r\\nnight before, and they all declared that if I had not been with them\\r\\nthey would have had to go without venison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men said that we had meat in plenty now and that we would not\\r\\nwatch the licks any more that time, so they put in their time jerking\\r\\nthe venison and also some of the bear meat. They built a large fire\\r\\nof hemlock bark, and when it was burned down to a bed of coals so\\r\\nthat there was no longer any smoke, they made a rack or grate of\\r\\nsmall poles, laid in crotches driven in the ground, so as to have the\\r\\ngrate over the coals, and then laid the slices of venison on this\\r\\ngrate and stood green bark about the grate to form a sort of an oven.\\r\\nThe strips of meat were first sprinkled with salt and wrapped up in\\r\\nthe skin from the deer and allowed to remain wrapped in the skin for\\r\\na few hours until the salt would strike through the meat so as to\\r\\nmake it about right as to salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men remained in camp about a week. They would shoot at a mark,\\r\\npitch quoits and have jumping contests and other amusements,\\r\\nincluding fishing, eating trout, venison and bear meat along with\\r\\ntoasted bread and coffee and potatoes roasted in the ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time had arrived when I thought that I must take to the taller\\r\\ntimber to trap and hunt. I searched among the boys of my age, in the\\r\\nneighborhood, for a partner who would go with me to the Big Woods, as\\r\\nthe section where I wished to go, was called. I finally found a pard\\r\\nwho said he would go with me and stay as long as I cared to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle of October came. We packed our knapsacks with a grub\\r\\nstake, a blanket or two, and taking our guns started for the Big\\r\\nWoods, with a feeling that is not known to those who are not lovers\\r\\nof the wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we only had a limited number of steel traps it was our intention\\r\\nto spend the first week in camp, building deadfalls for coon and mink\\r\\nand use the steel traps for fox. Our intention was to build as many\\r\\ndeadfalls as we would be able to attend to before we baited and set\\r\\nany of them. We had built our traps on many of the small brooks and\\r\\nstreams to the south and east of the camp, and had built traps on the\\r\\nstream on which the camp was located nearly a mile below camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a mile and a half below camp there was another branch coming in\\r\\nfrom the north. Pard and I started early one morning to finish the\\r\\nline of traps on the camp stream and then go up the stream that came\\r\\nfrom the north and build as many traps as we could during the balance\\r\\nof the day. We had finished the line of traps on the camp stream, and\\r\\nhad built a trap or two on the other branch, when pard complained of\\r\\nhaving a bad headache, but refused to go to camp. We built another\\r\\ntrap or two, when pard consented to go to camp, if I would build\\r\\nanother trap on a little spring run where coon signs were plentiful,\\r\\nwhich I readily consented to do. When I got the trap done it was\\r\\nnearly sundown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about three miles to camp so I hurried to see how pard was\\r\\nfeeling. I had not gone more than a half mile on my way from where\\r\\npard turned back to go to camp, when I found him lying on the ground.\\r\\nHe said that he was feeling so sick that he was unable to go any\\r\\nfurther and complained that every bone in his body ached.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter explaining to pard the conditions under which we were placed,\\r\\nit was with difficulty that I managed to get him up, and by\\r\\nsupporting and half carrying him I managed to get him along a few\\r\\nrods at a time. I could see that he was continually growing worse.\\r\\nAfter I had helped until we were within about three-quarters of a\\r\\nmile of camp, he begged me to let him lie down and rest. I tried to\\r\\nurge him along by explaining that I must go for a team to get him out\\r\\nof the woods, and that I could not leave him lying there on the damp\\r\\nground. It was of no use; I could not get him to go any further.\\r\\nWhile I was somewhat older than pard, he was much the heavier, and I\\r\\nwas unable to carry him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking in the situation, there was only one thing for me to do and\\r\\nthat was to leave him and go for help. After making him promise that\\r\\nas soon as he rested he would work his way to camp I took off my\\r\\ncoat, and put it under him, again making him promise to get to camp,\\r\\nI started for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was dark and it was miles through the woods to the first\\r\\nhouse. When I came to camp I stopped long enough to get a bite to eat\\r\\nwhich I took in my hand. After lighting a fire so if pard did manage\\r\\nto get to camp he would have a good fire, I started for help.\\r\\nWherever the light would get through the trees enough so that I could\\r\\nsee the path, I would take a trot. After the first mile and a half I\\r\\ncame to the turnpike road where I could make better time although it\\r\\nwas dense woods. After about six or seven miles I reached the first\\r\\nclearing and from there the rest of the way was more or less\\r\\nclearings and I could see the road better and was able to make better\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reached pard\\'s home about a mile before I came to my home, rattled\\r\\nat the door and called for pard\\'s father. I told him the condition of\\r\\nhis son. He requested me to go to my home and get some of my family\\r\\nto take a team and start back at once after his son; he would go\\r\\nafter a doctor and have the doctor there when we got back with the\\r\\nboy. I lost no time in getting started back. We could not get nearer\\r\\nthan a mile and a half to the camp, as we were obliged to leave the\\r\\nwagon road at that point, and go down a very steep hill and only a\\r\\ntrail cut through the woods. When we reached the camp, contrary to\\r\\nexpectations, we found Orlando (that was pard\\'s name) lying in the\\r\\nbunk in camp but he said that he was feeling no better. It was after\\r\\nmidnight and we lost no time in getting him on one of the horses and\\r\\nstarted back to the wagon which we reached with some difficulty. On\\r\\nreaching the wagon we laid him on a straw bed which we had brought\\r\\nfor the purpose and got back to his home sometime after daybreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor was there and after examining pard said he feared it was a\\r\\nbad case of fever. I waited a few days to see if he would be able to\\r\\ngo back to camp and then the doctor told me that he would not be out\\r\\nof bed in two months and advised me to keep out of the woods or I\\r\\nwould be brought out on a stretcher. I had my mind on all those\\r\\ndeadfalls that we had built and all the coon, mink and fox that we\\r\\ncould catch, and was determined to go back to camp notwithstanding\\r\\nour friend\\'s advice to the contrary. After looking around for another\\r\\npartner which I was unable to find as no one wished to go and stay\\r\\nlonger than a day or two (what we call summer trappers), I again\\r\\npacked my knapsack and went back to camp. The next morning, after\\r\\ncatching a good lot of trout for coon and mink bait, I began the work\\r\\nof setting the hundred or more deadfalls that pard and I had built.\\r\\nAs soon as I had all the deadfalls set I hunted up good places to set\\r\\nthe traps that we had. I was so busy all the time that there was no\\r\\nchance to get lonesome. Every day there were coon and mink to skin\\r\\nand stretch. Now and then a big, old coon was so strong that he would\\r\\ntear the deadfall to pieces and I would be compelled to build it all\\r\\nover and make it stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a difference there is now with the many styles of traps and the\\r\\nH-T-T to guide the young hunter and trapper. If I could have had a\\r\\ncouple dozen of the No. 1 1/2 Victor traps made as at the present\\r\\ntime, I would have been as proud as a small boy with a new pair of\\r\\nboots, although I think what was lacking in modern traps was fully\\r\\nmade up by the number of furbearing animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been so busy during the two weeks I was in camp that I had\\r\\nforgotten the day of the week; neither did I take time to kill a deer\\r\\nor to go up to the road to see if anyone had written, to see if I was\\r\\ndead or alive. There was a stage passed over the road twice a week. I\\r\\nhad nailed a box with a good tight lid on a tree by the road so that\\r\\nI could send a line out home for anything I wanted or my family could\\r\\nwrite to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had two or three traps set for foxes up towards the road along the\\r\\nedge of a laurel patch where there were plenty of rabbits and the\\r\\nfoxes worked around to catch rabbits. I thought I would go to the\\r\\nroad and be there about the time the stage passed along and see if I\\r\\ncould hear anything from pard and the folks at home and then I could\\r\\ntend the traps on my way back to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS CATCH.]\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at the road shortly before the stage came along and was\\r\\nsurprised as well as delighted to see a neighbor boy by the name of\\r\\nFrank Curtis aboard the stage as he had said he would come over and\\r\\nstay a day or two with me in camp. Frank had not been allowed to\\r\\nspend much time with a gun or traps, but like most boys, he liked a\\r\\ngun. My mother died before I was eleven years old and father allowed\\r\\nme to trap and hunt about as I liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got down near the traps we set our packs down--I say we, for\\r\\nmy folks had sent me a new supply of provisions--and went to look\\r\\nafter the traps. The first one had a rabbit leg in it and it was\\r\\nplain to be seen that some animal had eaten the rabbit. We reset the\\r\\ntrap and went on to the next trap which was set in a little gorge or\\r\\nhollow. A few yards below the trap two large trees had blown down\\r\\nacross the little hollow. The tree on the side farthest down the hill\\r\\nfrom the trap had broken in two where it fell over the hollow and\\r\\ndropped down so that it laid close to the ground while the tree on\\r\\nthe upper side, the side nearest the trap, lay a foot from the ground\\r\\nin the hollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trees were two or three feet apart right at the hollow but were\\r\\nclose together on one side. When we came to where the trap had been\\r\\nset we found trap and drag gone and nothing in sight. We soon\\r\\ndiscovered the animal which we supposed was a coon, had gone down the\\r\\nravine toward the two large trees that had fallen across the hollow.\\r\\nWe went to the logs and looked between them. There we could see the\\r\\nclog but the animal was crowded back under the logs so we could see\\r\\nbut little of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank said that he would get between the logs and poke the coon out.\\r\\nI told him that he had better let me go, as I was afraid that he\\r\\nwould take a hold of the clog and pull the trap loose from the coon\\'s\\r\\nfoot, but Frank grabbed a stick and jumped between the logs. He had\\r\\nhardly struck the ground when he gave a fearful yell and there was a\\r\\nspitting, snarling animal close at his heels. He scrambled out from\\r\\nbetween the logs, as white as a sheet. I then saw that it was a\\r\\nwildcat and a mad one. I cut a good stout stick and while Frank stood\\r\\non the bank with his gun, I poked the cat from under the log by\\r\\npunching it, until Frank could see it enough to shoot it. We pulled\\r\\nthe cat out from between the logs, took the trap from its foot, reset\\r\\nit and took the cat with our traps and went to camp, declaring in our\\r\\nminds that there was no other such mighty trappers as we.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank declared that he was nearly famished with hunger so we had\\r\\nsupper and then skinned the cat. We did not sleep much that night as\\r\\nFrank had to tell me all about things at home. He also told me that\\r\\npard was no better. Every time an owl would hoot, or a rabbit or\\r\\nporcupine or a mouse would make a noise in the leaves, Frank would\\r\\ngive me a punch and ask what it was. Frank remained three days in\\r\\ncamp and then he took the stage back home, that being as long as his\\r\\nparents would allow him to stay. I went to the road to see him off.\\r\\nWhen leaving he made many declarations that he would come back to\\r\\ncamp, although he never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow now began to lie on the ground as it fell and it began to\\r\\nget cold at night. Coon did but little traveling and some way, after\\r\\nFrank had been over to camp and stayed those three days, I seemed to\\r\\nget homesick. I had not become expert enough to make a business of\\r\\ndeer hunting and marten and bear trapping, so I sprung the deadfalls\\r\\nand took up the few steel traps that I had and began to take my furs\\r\\nand other plunder to the road to take the stage home. After going\\r\\nhome I went to school for a few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI no longer remember how many coon, mink and other furs I caught, but\\r\\nit was quite a bunch for furs were very plentiful in those days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Hunt on the Kinzua.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, as I have not been able to trap any for the past two\\r\\nyears--1905 and 1906--and as I have previously served for more than 50\\r\\nyears almost without cessation, along the trap line, I beg to be\\r\\nadmitted to your ranks as one of the \"Hasbeens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI will therefore tell of one of my trips on a hunting and trapping\\r\\nexpedition in the fall and winter of 1865-6, a party of two besides\\r\\nmyself. My two companions\\' names were Charles Manly and William\\r\\nHoward. We started about the 15th of October for Coudersport with a\\r\\nteam of horses and wagon loaded with the greater part of our outfit\\r\\nand went to Emporium, Cameron County, where we hit the Philadelphia\\r\\nand Erie Railroad. The only railroad that touched Northwestern\\r\\nPennsylvania at that time. Here we took the railroad to Kane, a town\\r\\nin Southwestern McKean County, where we stopped one day and made\\r\\npurchases for three months\\' camping. We hired a good team here to\\r\\ntake our outfit about seven or eight miles on to Kinzua Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost the entire distance was through the woods and over the rock.\\r\\nThere was no sign of a road only as we went ahead of the team and cut\\r\\na tree or log here and there. The outfit was lashed onto a bobsled,\\r\\nand as we had bargained with the man to make the trip for a stated\\r\\nprice, he did not seem to care whether there was any road or not, so\\r\\nthat he got through as quickly as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached the stream about noon. The man fed his team some oats,\\r\\nswallowed a few mouthsful himself and was soon on his way back to\\r\\ntown, while we began laying plans for our camp. We selected a spot on\\r\\na little rise of ground near a good spring of water, and where there\\r\\nwas plenty of small yellow birch trees handy to cut logs out of for\\r\\ncamp. We placed a good sized log down first at the end of the shanty\\r\\nthat we intended to build the fire place in. Another was placed at\\r\\nthe end that was to be the highest, so to give the right slope to the\\r\\nroof, which was a shed roof. We always kept the large ends of the\\r\\nlogs one way, so that when we had the logs rolled up it made the\\r\\nlower or eaves end of the camp about five feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a slope of about two feet for the roof. We felled bass wood\\r\\ntrees which we split in half, and then dug or scooped them out so as\\r\\nto make a trough. We notched the two end logs down and then placed\\r\\nthe scoops or troughs in these notches so that they would lay firm\\r\\nwith the hollow side up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter placing these scoops across the entire width of the shack we\\r\\nthen placed another layer of the scoops (reverse) on the first set.\\r\\nThat is to say, the rounding side up. This made a very good roof but\\r\\nrequired a good deal of chinking at the ends to keep the cold out,\\r\\nbut as moss was plenty, it was not a long job. The second day after\\r\\nwe got into the woods we had the camp in pretty good shape, well\\r\\nchinked and calked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day we worked on the fire place, laying it up to the jam of\\r\\nstone, then we finished the chimney with logs and mud. We had a\\r\\nfairly comfortable camp with but two exceptions. These were, no\\r\\nwindows, and for a door we had what I called a \"hoghole,\" that was a\\r\\ndoor so small that one had to get down on all fours to get in or out.\\r\\nOn the fourth day we intended to cut wood all day, and were at it\\r\\nbefore it was fairly light, but before 10 o\\'clock it began to snow.\\r\\nIn a couple of hours there was a good tracking snow and the boys were\\r\\nbound to go out and see if they could not kill a deer. I tried hard\\r\\nto get them to stick to the wood job, but it was no use, they must go\\r\\nhunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no partnership business in this hunt. It was every man for\\r\\nhimself, and the dogs, take the hindermost. I told the boys I would\\r\\nstay in camp and do something at the wood job.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been along the creek a little the day before, poking my nose\\r\\nunder the banks and old drifts to see what manner of signs I could\\r\\nsee, and I had noticed several mink tracks. The boys had no more than\\r\\ngone when I had a fishing tackle rigged out. It consisted of a line\\r\\nbraided from horsehair, out of a horse\\'s tail, and a hook baited with\\r\\nsome bits of fat pork. It did the business, for the stream fairly\\r\\nswarmed with trout. Taking three or four trout for bait, I was soon\\r\\nat work building deadfalls. It was not long before I had three or\\r\\nfour built close up under the banks and behind logs where I thought\\r\\nthe boys would not see them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then scampered back to camp and went to cutting wood like a good\\r\\nboy. I had only just got to camp when I heard a gun shot away up the\\r\\ncreek, and in about an hour Charley came dragging a yearling deer.\\r\\nWill did not show up for some time after dark, but had nothing,\\r\\nthough he said that he had a fair standing shot at a large buck, but\\r\\nhis gun snapped on him and he lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we were out at the peep of day, each one going his\\r\\nown way. I went down the creek so that I could take a peep at my\\r\\ntraps. None had been disturbed until I came to the last one. There,\\r\\nto my satisfaction, I found a mink. As I had passed a small run that\\r\\nemptied into the main creek I noticed that some animal had gone over\\r\\na pole that lay across a little run and partly in the water. The\\r\\nanimal had brushed the snow off the pole in going over it. I gave it\\r\\nno particular attention, thinking that it was a coon, but when I got\\r\\nthe mink I thought I would go back to camp, make a stretching board\\r\\nand stretch the mink skin and get a trap and set at the run for the\\r\\ncoon, as I supposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will mention that furs were bringing about the same prices then as\\r\\nat the present time, 1907, a good No. 1 mink being worth about $10.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the camp was a large elm tree that was hollow, and the fire had\\r\\nburned a hole out on one side up the tree, nearly as high as a man\\'s\\r\\nhead. After I had stretched the mink skin I hung it up in this hollow\\r\\ntree, and it was a very good place to dry the pelts that I caught.\\r\\nThe boys never mistrusted that I was doing any trapping for small\\r\\ngame.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get back to my job, I took one out of three steel traps No. 3, and\\r\\nall the traps that we had brought with us. In fact, the other boys\\r\\ndid not care to trap. When I got back at the run I gave more\\r\\nattention to the trail of the supposed coon, and discovered that it\\r\\nwas an otter. With greater caution I waded up the run until I found a\\r\\nsuitable place to set the trap, knowing that he would be back that\\r\\nway again sooner or later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter setting the trap I climbed the ridge to look for deer and got\\r\\ntwo shots during the afternoon but missed both. All came to camp that\\r\\nnight without killing any deer. I had seen a number of marten tracks\\r\\nduring the afternoon. The next morning it was thawing and the boys\\r\\nfeared they would lose the tracking snow, so Charley and Will hurried\\r\\nto localities where they expected to find deer. I sliced some strips\\r\\nof venison from the fore-quarters, or rather what was left of the\\r\\nfore-quarters, of the deer Charley had killed the first day out. I\\r\\nmade tracks to the ridge where I had seen the marten tracks, and I\\r\\nlost no time in putting up deadfalls at the best pace I was capable\\r\\nof getting into.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon on my way to camp I came to the creek some ways\\r\\nbelow where I had set the mink traps, so I put up two or three more\\r\\ndeadfalls for mink. I also found a big flood drift which otter were\\r\\nusing for their feeding grounds. I selected places to set the other\\r\\ntwo steel traps which were in camp, and then went to camp, looking at\\r\\nthe mink traps on the way, but found that none had been disturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got to camp I found both Charley and Will there, and each had\\r\\nkilled a deer. Will had killed a good sized buck close to camp, so he\\r\\ndragged it down to the shanty to dress and hang up. The boys gave me\\r\\nthe laugh because I had not killed any deer. I told them to hold\\r\\ntheir breath and I would get into the harness after a bit. In the\\r\\nmorning the snow was all gone and the boys were afraid that it was\\r\\ngoing to get so warm that their venison would spoil. Cuts were drawn\\r\\nto see which one of them should go to Kane to get a team to take out\\r\\ntheir venison. It fell on Charley. They tried to have me join in the\\r\\ndraw, but I told them that I did not see where I came in as I had no\\r\\nvenison to spoil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather kept warm for several days, so I kept building deadfalls\\r\\non the different ridges for marten and along the creek for mink and\\r\\ncoon. Charley and Will continued to still hunt, killing several deer.\\r\\nWhen the snow came again I had all the traps up I intended to build,\\r\\nbut it turned out that later I built two deadfalls for bear. I now\\r\\nput in my time still hunting, shaping my course as much as possible\\r\\nso as to tend to my traps. I killed a deer occasionally as did the\\r\\nother boys. I set the two steel traps on the drift where I had seen\\r\\nthe otter signs, and the second time I looked at them I found an\\r\\notter tangled up in one of the traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was also getting mink, marten and coon now and then, and\\r\\noccasionally I would get two mink or marten in one day. I would cut a\\r\\nlong slender withe to stretch the skins over, bending them in the\\r\\nform of a stretching board the best I could and hang the pelts in the\\r\\nold elm tree and kept mum. I remembered the old adage, \"he that\\r\\nlaughs last, laughs best,\" and was bound to have the last laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night Will came in and said that a bear had eaten up the offal\\r\\nwhere he had dressed a deer. I asked him if he was going to set a\\r\\ntrap for him, and he said that he had no trap to set. I told him to\\r\\nbuild a deadfall. Will said that I could have that job if I wanted\\r\\nit. I told him all right if he would tell me where to find the place.\\r\\nHe said that he would go with me in the morning and show me. In the\\r\\nmorning I took the best axe, some bait and went with Will to the\\r\\nplace where the bear had eaten the offal. We saw that the bear had\\r\\nbeen back there during the night and cleaned up the remains left the\\r\\nprevious night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI selected a good sized beech tree, where I could fell it so that I\\r\\ncould cut a piece from the butt for the bottom piece and have the\\r\\nremainder of the tree come so that I could use a small tree for one\\r\\nof the stakes or posts. When I pulled off my coat and began chopping\\r\\non the tree Will gave me the laugh again, and said that I had more\\r\\ndays\\' work in me than brains, or something to that effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my intention to get the trap all ready and then get one of the\\r\\nboys to help me set it. I got the trap done and saw that by using a\\r\\nlong lever or pry I could set the trap without the aid of another.\\r\\nWith the pry I raised the dead piece up as high as I wanted it. Then\\r\\ntied the lever to a sapling to hold the dead log in place, using the\\r\\nfigure four trigger. I placed a bit of log in the bait pen to rest\\r\\nthe bait spindle on. I then placed the trigger in place and pressed\\r\\nthem between the logs to steady them until I could release the lever\\r\\nand let the weight onto the trigger. I then put some poles onto the\\r\\ndead log to make doubly sure that I had weight enough to kill any\\r\\nbear that traveled those woods. I now went to camp giving myself\\r\\ncredit of doing a good job.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the boys came in the night of the day I built the first deadfall\\r\\nfor bear, they both reported seeing bear tracks and they said the\\r\\ntracks all seemed to be going south. I told the boys that the bear\\r\\nwere looking up winter quarters, and that if we would all go at it\\r\\nand put up several deadfalls we would stand a fair chance to get a\\r\\nbear or two, but it was no go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey said they would give me a clean title to all the bear I could\\r\\ncatch, but they did not care to invest. So I took the axe and some\\r\\nbait and went to the head of a small draft where the boys had seen\\r\\nthe bear tracks. I found at the head of this hollow what seemed to be\\r\\na bear runway or crossing, for three or four bears had passed around\\r\\nthe head of this basin in the past few days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith some hard work and heavy lifting I got another good deadfall\\r\\nbuilt that day. The next day I went the rounds of the marten and mink\\r\\ntraps, and I think I killed a deer and got two marten. I remember\\r\\nthat at this time we had a good snow to hunt on, and that it was not\\r\\nan uncommon thing for us to cut wood for the camp long after dark,\\r\\nand sometimes it was pretty scant at that. I think it was the third\\r\\nday after I had set the first bear trap when Will came in, shortly\\r\\nafter Charley and I had got to camp, and as he stuck his head through\\r\\nthe hoghole (as I called the substitute for a door) he says, a fool\\r\\nfor luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspicioned what was coming and said, \"Well, what kind of luck have\\r\\nyou had?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWill said, \"It is not me that has had the luck, but you have got one\\r\\nof the Jed-blasted bears up there in that rigging you built, you ever\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember that I had some kind of a hipo that night, so that I would\\r\\nlaugh every now and then \"kindy\" all by myself. I do not think that I\\r\\nslept much that night, though it was not the first bear I had ever\\r\\ncaught. I thought it was beginning to look as though the laugh was\\r\\ncoming my way all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the boys went to the trap with me and helped get the\\r\\nbear out of the trap and helped set the trap again, and then went on\\r\\nwith their deer hunting. I went to skinning the bear, and it was all\\r\\nI did that day to skin that bear and stretch the skin on the shanty.\\r\\nI told the boys when they came in that night that I thought we were\\r\\ngoing to have a hard winter, and so I concluded to weatherboard the\\r\\ncamp with bear skins. The carcass of the bear was, of course, a\\r\\ncomplete loss, and that is a serious objection to the deadfall as a\\r\\nbear trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that it was about this time that Will met with an accident in\\r\\nhis foot gear, so he went out to Kane after a pair of gum shoes. At\\r\\nthis time we had several deer so thought it best to have the team\\r\\ncome in and take them out and ship them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Will came back that evening he said that some kind of an animal\\r\\nhad crossed the path about one-half mile from camp, dragging\\r\\nsomething. He said that he could not make up his mind what it was,\\r\\nbut thought it was some kind of an animal in a trap, but we knew of\\r\\nno one trapping in that locality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not know but it might be possible that some animal had gotten\\r\\nin one of my otter traps and had broken the chain and gone off with\\r\\nthe trap. Early in the morning I went down the creek to look at the\\r\\ntraps and see if they were all right. When I came to the Spring Run I\\r\\nsaw that my otter (or at least I called it my otter), had again gone\\r\\nup the run, on his usual round of travel. When I came to where the\\r\\ntrap was it wasn\\'t there at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had fastened the trap to a root that was two or three inches under\\r\\nwater and a root that I supposed sound. I was mistaken, for the root\\r\\nwas pretty doty and the otter had broken the root and gone with my\\r\\ntrap. I lost no time in taking up the chase. The trail led up this\\r\\nrun to its source, then over a spur of ridge and down the hill again\\r\\ninto a branch of the main stream, then up this branch for a distance\\r\\nof a mile or more, where I came up with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had gone under the roots of a large hemlock tree, and it took me\\r\\ntwo or three hours to get him out with nothing to work with only my\\r\\nbelt axe and a sharpened stake. It was nearly night when I got to\\r\\ncamp. I made a stretching board from a spault I split out of a\\r\\nbasswood log and stretched the otter skin, and put in the balance of\\r\\nthe day in chopping wood. One of the boys killed three deer that day.\\r\\nI do not remember which one it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day I made the rounds of nearly all the traps and got what I\\r\\nhave many a time before--nothing. I put in three or four days still\\r\\nhunting and had the luck to kill a deer or two, but Charley and Will\\r\\nkilled more than I did. I remember, during this time, they were all\\r\\nthe time joking me because they were getting more deer than I did. I\\r\\nclaimed that they had the best grounds to hunt on, they hunting east\\r\\nof the camp and up nearer the head of the stream, while I hunted west\\r\\nof the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would see bear tracks nearly every day, and Will and Charley would\\r\\ntry to get around in their hunting course so as to look at the two\\r\\nbear traps, the traps being in the direction in which they hunted.\\r\\nThey found the traps undisturbed. I had about made up my mind that I\\r\\nwould get no more bear that trip. I was getting a marten, mink or\\r\\ncoon now and then, so that I kept a stiff upper lip if the boys did\\r\\nkill a few deer more than I did. Finally one night when I came to\\r\\ncamp I found the carcass of a bear, skin and all lying at the shanty\\r\\ndoor. I thought it was one that either Charley or Will had killed. I\\r\\nfound that the boys by chance had met near one of the bear traps, and\\r\\ngoing to the trap found the bear. As it was a small one they took it\\r\\nout, set the trap and brought the bear to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now getting along in December and the snow was getting rather\\r\\ndeep and the weather was pretty cold and the game did not move about\\r\\nvery much. We all seemed to get a little lazy, and did not get out\\r\\ntill after noon. In fact, some days, if the weather was pretty sharp,\\r\\nwe did not go out at all but would stay in camp and talk of the hunt\\r\\nand tell where we thought we could find a bunch of deer over in this\\r\\nbasin or on that ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most of the deadfalls set I had not covered so to keep the snow\\r\\noff. A good many of them had snowed under, so I did not care how soon\\r\\nwe broke camp and went home. Deer were quite plentiful, and we could\\r\\nfind them nearly every day, when we would get a move on, so we\\r\\ncontinued to stay day after day, and putting in about one-half the\\r\\ntime hunting and the other half telling what we would have done if\\r\\nthere had not been so many \"ifs\" in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would usually shape my course in hunting so as to come around where\\r\\nsome of the deadfalls were and spring them. One day I came to one\\r\\nthat was pretty well snowed under. I saw that a fox had done a good\\r\\ndeal of traveling around the trap and had dug in the snow some about\\r\\nwhere I thought a marten would be, providing one was there. I kicked\\r\\nthe snow away, and to my delight and surprise I found as good a\\r\\nmarten as I had caught. I thanked the fox for the favor. I examined\\r\\nall the traps then to make sure that there was nothing in them, but I\\r\\nfound no more marten.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now began to get our venison into camp, taking turns to help each\\r\\nother. I do not just remember how many deer we killed, but I think\\r\\nthat Charley and Will killed 15 or 16 apiece, and I killed either 11\\r\\nor 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys said I had done pretty well considering the two bear and\\r\\notter, but when I went to the old elm and brought out the marten,\\r\\nmink and another otter and five or six coon, the boys looked greatly\\r\\namazed and Will said, \"I knew the fool was doing something besides\\r\\nhunting,\" Charley said he thought he could smell something that\\r\\nsmelled like mink around the camp three or four times. I think I got\\r\\n13 marten, 8 mink, 5 coon, 2 otter and 2 bears. As near as I can\\r\\nremember, I got a little over a hundred dollars for the fur. I do not\\r\\nremember what we got for the venison, but it was war prices. We\\r\\nshipped our venison to George Herbermann, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to have the boys help cut a lot of wood for the next season\\'s\\r\\nhunt, but they said they were not counting chickens as far ahead as\\r\\nthat. They hit it right, for neither of them hunted in there. I think\\r\\nCharley hunted on Hunt\\'s Run in Cameron County, and I do not know\\r\\nwhether Will hunted at all the next season, but I took a partner and\\r\\nwent back on the Kinzua.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time we were in \"swacks,\" and I will try to tell what luck we\\r\\nhad some time, but one thing we did was to put a window in the camp\\r\\nand make the door large enough so that one did not have to get down\\r\\non all fours to get in or out. Will and I stayed in camp while\\r\\nCharley went out to Kane and sent in the team to take out the venison\\r\\nand the furs and the camp outfit. We got home for Christmas and found\\r\\nall well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Last Hunt on the Kinzua.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this hunt was about 1868, before there were railroads in this\\r\\nsection, we went to Emporium, Cameron County, Pennsylvania, and there\\r\\ntook the train to Kane, in McKean County, then by team and bobsled\\r\\nroute to camp. This making the journey much farther, we concluded to\\r\\ngo by wagon the entire distance, which would shorten the distance\\r\\nnearly one-half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time conditions were different than on previous occasion. While\\r\\nthere were three in the party before and every one hunted on his own\\r\\nhook, this time I had a partner and we were to share alike in profit\\r\\nand loss. My partner\\'s name was William Earl, and he had recently\\r\\nmoved from Vermont, or, as he would jokingly say, from \"Varmount.\" He\\r\\nwas somewhat older than myself, and a man who was ever ready to carry\\r\\nhis end of the load at all times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hired a team and took a full line of grub and the camp outfit,\\r\\nwith about sixty small traps and eight bear traps. We went by way of\\r\\nPort Allegheny, Devils Blow and Smithport, taking three days to get\\r\\nto camp, as we had to cut out the road a good part of the distance of\\r\\nthe last day\\'s travel. They had just begun to operate in the oil\\r\\nindustry in the neighborhood of what is now the city of Bradford, and\\r\\nas they used wood altogether for fuel to drill with, there was a\\r\\ngreat deal of wood being cut for the purpose. Bill, as my partner was\\r\\nfamiliarly called, used to say that if we could not get fat on\\r\\nvenison and bear meat we would take a wood job, but we found plenty\\r\\nto do without the wood job.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the camp the first thing noticeable was that the old\\r\\nhollow elm that I had used for a dryhouse to hang up skins in, had\\r\\nmet with foul play, for it lay on the ground, having blown down. This\\r\\nmade it necessary to build a sort of leanto against one side of the\\r\\nshanty to hang up our furs, as we did not like to have them hung up\\r\\nin the shanty where they would get more or less smoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the first thing we did was to enlarge the door, for it will be\\r\\nremembered that we were obliged to get down on all fours in order to\\r\\nget in or out of the shanty. As we had a good crosscut saw, it did\\r\\nnot take long to enlarge the doorway so that one could go in standing\\r\\nup, man fashion. We next cut a window-hole large enough to take a\\r\\nsingle sash window. Then we replaced the chinkings that the\\r\\nporcupines had gnawed out, calked and mudded all cracks. When this\\r\\nwas done, Bill looked it over and said, \"By gum, don\\'t it look like\\r\\nliving?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was only about the middle of October we went to work at once on\\r\\na good supply of wood for the camp. We did not quit until we were\\r\\nsure that we had plenty to last the winter, for we intended to stay\\r\\nas long as it was either profitable or a pleasure. After the wood was\\r\\ncut and piled up near the shanty door, we next set the bear traps, as\\r\\nwe had brought bait for the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the bear traps were set we next looked over the deadfalls that\\r\\nI had built for marten the fall before, putting in a new stake where\\r\\nnecessary. We also set crotches and laid poles on them, then covering\\r\\nwith hemlock boughs to keep the snow from falling directly on the\\r\\ntrap. We fixed up the two deadfalls I had made for bear, as we wished\\r\\nto get all the bear traps out that we could, as we had already seen\\r\\nseveral signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also built a number more deadfalls for marten on different ridges\\r\\nfarther up the stream where I had not set any the fall before. We\\r\\nbuilt a number of deadfalls along the streams for mink and coon. It\\r\\nwas now getting well along towards the last days of October, so we\\r\\nput in a couple of days hunting deer, as we had to have bait to set\\r\\nour marten and other traps with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day\\'s hunting we did not get a deer, though we each got a\\r\\nrunning shot but missed. The second day I did not see any deer but\\r\\nBill killed a good sized buck before noon. We now began setting the\\r\\ntraps that we had built. Bill baiting and setting the deadfalls,\\r\\nwhile I commenced on the steel traps. We had not baited and set any\\r\\nof the deadfalls that we had built up to this time. The steel traps\\r\\nwe set for fox and wildcats, as there was a bounty of two dollars on\\r\\nwildcats at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn setting out the fox traps the knowledge that I had got of the\\r\\nlocality was of much benefit to me. I had kept a watch out for warm\\r\\nsprings and other good likely places to catch a fox or other animals.\\r\\nAfter we had all the deadfalls and steel traps out but three or four\\r\\notter traps, we set one or two at the drift where I caught one the\\r\\nfall before. The others we set where we found otter signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile setting the traps we got a marten or two, as well as one or two\\r\\nmink and coon. We had had one or two little flurries of snow, but we\\r\\ndid not leave the traps to hunt deer. Now that the traps were all\\r\\nset, we divided up the trap lines as best we could for each one to\\r\\nattend to while hunting deer. In dividing up the lines in this way we\\r\\nsaved much time, as we would not both be working the same territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow business began to get quite lively, and we were seldom in camp\\r\\nuntil after dark, and we were up early and had breakfast over and our\\r\\nlunch packed in our knapsacks. The lunch usually consisted of a good\\r\\nbig hunk of boiled venison and a couple of doughnuts and a few\\r\\ncrackers, occasionally the breast of a partridge, fried in coon or\\r\\nbear oil. Sometimes the lunch would freeze in the knapsacks and it\\r\\nwould be necessary to gather a little paper bark from a yellow birch\\r\\nand a little rosin from a hemlock, black birch or hard maple tree and\\r\\nbuild a little fire to thaw the lunch. This, however, was quickly\\r\\ndone, and was a pleasure rather than a hardship. I have delighted in\\r\\neating the lunch in this manner for many a winter on the trap line or\\r\\ntrail, as have many other hunters and trappers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill and I always had our lunch packed and ready to take up the trail\\r\\nat the first peep of day. Sometimes when we would get in late, tired\\r\\nand wet and our clothes frozen, I would suggest to Bill that we shut\\r\\nup camp and take a wood job, just to see what Bill would have to say.\\r\\nHe would say that there would be time to take a wood job in the\\r\\nspring or after he had killed a certain large buck which is usually\\r\\ncalled \"Old Golden.\" There were but a few days but what we either\\r\\ncaught some fur or killed a deer, though sometimes we would have a\\r\\nbad streak of luck by wounding a deer, or having some animal take a\\r\\nfoot off and escape, but this would make us all the more eager to\\r\\nfollow the trail or trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK ON THE TRAP LINE.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we had gotten by this time several deer and had caught three bear\\r\\n(one in one of the deadfalls that I had built the fall before, that\\r\\nWill Howard called that \"dashed dinged riggin\\',\" when he found the\\r\\nbear in it) we wanted to get them out to Kane, that being the nearest\\r\\npoint to a railroad. We started early one morning, Bill taking an axe\\r\\nand I carrying the saw, so that if we found any large trees across\\r\\nthe trail that we had cut out the year before we would have the saw\\r\\nto do it with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter carrying the saw some distance and not finding any trees of\\r\\nmuch size across the road, we left it and only took the axe. We found\\r\\nbut very little in the trail to cut out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got to Kane in time to engage a man with team to come to camp the\\r\\nnext day and take out the venison and bear and bring in some\\r\\nnecessary commissaries that we were getting short of. It was only a\\r\\nfew days after this that I found that a bear got in one of the traps.\\r\\nThe trap chain having a swivel that was pretty well worn, broke, and\\r\\nthe bear went off with the trap. I followed the trail until the\\r\\nmiddle of the afternoon, when I became satisfied that Bruin was\\r\\ndisgusted with that locality, as he had continued his course nearly\\r\\ndue east without a stop. I could see no signs that led me to think\\r\\nthat Bruin intended to stop for the next fifty miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I gave up the chase and went to camp, getting there long after all\\r\\ngood boys should have been in bed. Bill was up and out at the door\\r\\nlistening if he could hear a gun shot or anything to indicate what\\r\\nhad become of me. We held a council of war before going to bed, and\\r\\ndecided to give Bruin another day\\'s rest or travel, as he saw fit to\\r\\ndo, before we started on the trail. We would go to all the traps that\\r\\nhad not been tended to in the past three or four days and then take\\r\\nup the trail of Bruin and follow him to the end of his trail, no\\r\\nmatter how long the trail might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was but little danger of the trail becoming snowed under or\\r\\nlost, as there was nearly a foot of snow on the ground, and the trap\\r\\nwould make a broad trail in the snow, which was quite easily\\r\\nfollowed. The next day, as intended, we put in a full day attending\\r\\nthe traps and got some fur, but I do not remember just what. We\\r\\nstarted out on the trail of Bruin with a three days\\' ration of the\\r\\nusual lunch, boiled venison, ham, doughnuts and biscuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter following the trail about two hours from the place where I had\\r\\nleft it, we came onto a man\\'s track that had taken the trail of our\\r\\nbear. This roiled the temper of the Vermonter somewhat, and if I did\\r\\nnot say anything, I had a mighty think on. But we had no cause for\\r\\nalarm at this time. The man after following the trail for a mile or\\r\\ntwo gave up the chase as a bad job, I guess. He stood and stamped\\r\\nabout for some time (we judged by the tracks he had made) and then\\r\\nstarted back nearly in the same course that he had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe followed on until dark when we came to a wagon road. Apparently\\r\\nseveral persons had seen the bear trail, for there was a beaten path\\r\\nfor a few yards on either side of the road. We knew nothing about the\\r\\nroad or where it went, but finally concluded to take the road leading\\r\\nsouth for a little ways. If we saw no signs of habitation then we\\r\\nwould camp, as that was what we expected to be compelled to do when\\r\\nstarting from camp and each had taken a blanket for the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not gone far when a man with a sleigh overtook us, and we\\r\\nlearned that we were about one and a half miles from what was called\\r\\nBunker Hill. The man gave us a ride. We went to a boarding house and\\r\\nstayed over night, rather than camping on Bruin\\'s trail, though we\\r\\ngot plenty of camping on the trail of Bruin before this hunt was at\\r\\nan end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we were out early and had breakfast at 6 o\\'clock and\\r\\nstarted for the trail which we reached before daylight. We had gone a\\r\\nlittle way when we heard voices coming along the road. We listened a\\r\\nmoment and saw that it was a party of three men who had come to take\\r\\nthe bear\\'s trail. We waited until they came up to us and one man\\r\\nsaid, \"What in blazes are you fellows doing on this bear\\'s track?\"\\r\\nBill replied rather sharp, \"That\\'s our business, but what are you\\r\\nhere for?\" Then they said that one of the men had seen the track the\\r\\nevening before and as there was no one after it, they had come out to\\r\\nfollow up the track and kill the bear. They insisted on going after\\r\\nthe bear but after some talk we convinced them that we did not need\\r\\nany help and they turned back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took up the trail and followed it pretty lively for a time, as we\\r\\ndid not know but those men would cut around and take the trail ahead\\r\\nof us, though they did not do so. We were now on the waters of Potato\\r\\nCreek and there was a good deal of laurel and here we found the first\\r\\nplace that Bruin had stopped and made a bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is usually the case that a bear that has a trap on his foot will\\r\\nnot travel any great distance before they stop and make a bed and\\r\\nthen move a short distance and make another bed. Bruin now began to\\r\\nact more natural, to his family. We began to think that we would soon\\r\\ncome to fresh signs at least, but were disappointed for we did not\\r\\nfollow the trail far, after we came onto his bed before two men\\'s\\r\\ntracks fell in and took up the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter following for some time on the trail of the men and bear, we\\r\\ncame to where the bear had made another stop and we could see that\\r\\nthe bear\\'s track was much fresher showing that it had stopped some\\r\\ntime. We expected that the men would divide here, one taking the\\r\\ntrail while the other worked on the side, but both men continued on\\r\\nthe same trail. After following the trail for three or four hundred\\r\\nyards farther, we came onto another bed and this time the bear went\\r\\nout on the jump and Bill said some cuss words about the men. It is\\r\\npossible that I did too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trail here turned north. This took us into a section more thickly\\r\\nsettled and hunters more numerous. The greater part of the time there\\r\\nwas from one to two men on the trail ahead of us and all that was\\r\\nleft for us to do was to follow on as fast as we could. The second\\r\\nnight we were on the head of Salt Run and we followed the trail till\\r\\ndark. We now had the bear trail to follow instead of the men as all\\r\\nthe men had left to go to their camps or homes. Bill said that we\\r\\nwould sleep \"dash-dang\" close to the trail after this, so we soon\\r\\nfound a large log to build a fire against. First we would build the\\r\\nfire out a few feet from the log after scraping the snow away. Then\\r\\nwe would throw a few hemlock boughs over a pole laid in crotches and\\r\\nthen move the fire down against the log, throw a few boughs on the\\r\\nground where the fire had been moved from and the camp was complete\\r\\nin a very few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now began to fear that some one would get in ahead of us and kill\\r\\nthe bear and we would lose bear, trap and all. Bill said that we\\r\\nwould follow so \"dash-darn\" close that we would be up in time to\\r\\nattend the funeral. We were so close up that we were no longer\\r\\nbothered only a little while at a time as we would soon overtook any\\r\\none who hit the trail ahead of us and followed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear again turned east which took us across the road which runs\\r\\nfrom Coudersport to Emporium in Cameron County. We were now back in\\r\\nPotter County and only 15 miles from home. Bruin here turned south\\r\\nand true to his nature, led us through all the windfalls and laurel\\r\\npatches to be found and occasionally would break down a few laurel\\r\\nand act as though he intended to camp for a time but apparently would\\r\\nchange his mind and go on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now on the waters of the Conley and night was fast coming on.\\r\\nThe trail led across a little bog and we were looking for water and a\\r\\nsuitable place to camp, when Bill called my attention to a man\\r\\nstanding on the trail watching us. When we came to him it proved to\\r\\nbe a neighbor of ours. Mr. Ephraim Reed, who was hunting in there and\\r\\nsaid that his camp was only a little way down the hollow and asked us\\r\\nto go down and stay over night. We were glad to do so. Mr. Reed said\\r\\nthat there were a good many hunters in that locality so we were up\\r\\nand on the trail before it was fairly light.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were in a section where there was a great deal of laurel and Bruin\\r\\ncontinued to make camps but as often would change his mind and move\\r\\non and Bill thought he had concluded to go to the can brake in\\r\\nVirginia. Often when he would go into a wind jam or laurel thicket,\\r\\nwe would separate, one taking a circuit on one side of the thicket,\\r\\nthe other on the other side, meeting on the opposite side from where\\r\\nthe trail had entered but we would always find that Bruin was still\\r\\non the go. We were in a locality where there were apparently a good\\r\\nmany deer and we saw signs of marten quite often.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now on the head waters of Hunts Run in Cameron county and we\\r\\ndecided to make that section our next hunting ground. While the trail\\r\\nwould wind about some, yet bruin\\'s general course was south. Often\\r\\nwhen bruin would vary considerably from his general course and go\\r\\ninto a thicket or wind jam, we would feel sure that this time we\\r\\nwould find him napping, but we were disappointed each time. Once when\\r\\nwe were circling one of these thickets, I drove a deer out and it ran\\r\\nto Bill who gave him his finish. We were near a lumber camp and sold\\r\\nit for ten dollars and our night\\'s lodging and some grub. We were now\\r\\ngetting pretty well down to the railroad near Sterling Run. We were\\r\\nsure that bruin was going to cross the railroad so we left the trail\\r\\nand went down to the railroad and followed along the road until we\\r\\ncame to the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear had crossed the road during the night and no one had noticed\\r\\nthe trail. Here I suggested to Bill that we take a train to Kane and\\r\\ngo to camp and go out and take a wood job, but Bill thought that we\\r\\nhad about all the job on our hands that we were able to attend to. He\\r\\nwas right, for as near as I can remember, the trail led us nearly a\\r\\nhalf day\\'s tramp before bruin made a stop. The foot that the trap was\\r\\non began to bleed considerably. We began to fear that the foot would\\r\\ncome off and bruin relieved of the trap would escape after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now had some more help, two men took the trail ahead of us\\r\\nfollowing it until nearly dark when they apparently held a council of\\r\\nwar, judging from the way they tracked about where they left the\\r\\ntrail. We were now in a pine slashing and concluded to camp on the\\r\\ntrail, though we knew that we were not far from a lumber camp as we\\r\\ncould hear men chopping and driving oxen. We were lucky in finding a\\r\\ngood place to camp and water close at hand. As we had a small tin\\r\\npail with us and coffee, we made a pail of coffee and ate our lunch\\r\\nand fixed our bunk, then we sat down before the fire for a time and\\r\\ntalked over what we thought we might do the next day. Then we rolled\\r\\nup in our blankets and it was time to get the coffee boiling again\\r\\nbefore we were hardly aware that we had been asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBruin now began to act more like a sensible bear and would zigzag\\r\\nabout from one thicket to another. We now got close enough to him so\\r\\nthat we heard him in the brush several times. Bill said that he\\r\\nthought that bruin was about to make up his mind to let us take off\\r\\nthat handcuff. He proved to be right, for it was not long before\\r\\nbruin\\'s trail led down onto the side of a steep ravine. The sides\\r\\nwere not more than one hundred yards apart and were quite clear (only\\r\\nfor the piles of pine tree tops) from fallen trees, that had been\\r\\ntaken out for logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were standing a little way down the side of the ravine, laying\\r\\nplans as to our next move, as we had come to the conclusion that\\r\\nbruin had either turned down along the side of the ravine or had gone\\r\\ninto camp. We had planned that one would go up around the head of the\\r\\nravine while the other waited on the trail until the one that went\\r\\naround should get on the opposite side. While still laying plans, we\\r\\nsaw bruin come out on the opposite side and began to climb the hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had followed the bear for six days and this was the first time\\r\\nthat we had seen his lordship. He would go a few steps and stop and\\r\\nlook back. We watched our opportunity and when he made a stop, we\\r\\nboth fired. Bruin made a jump or two up the hill then tumbled back\\r\\ndown again and the fun had ended. We took the entrails out and left\\r\\nhim lying across a log and went down the ravine to where there was a\\r\\nlumber camp and there we found that we were on Dent\\'s Run, a branch\\r\\nof Bennet\\'s Branch and in Elk county.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the fourth county we had been in since we had taken the\\r\\nbear\\'s trail. They told us at the lumber camp that there would be\\r\\nthree or four teams go down to the railroad station at Driftwood the\\r\\nnext morning with spars which they were hauling to the river to raft.\\r\\nWe got a man with a yoke of oxen and a bobsled to go with us and get\\r\\nthe bear and the next morning about 5 o\\'clock we got the bear\\r\\nstrapped onto one of the spars and started down the stream to the\\r\\nrailroad and we shipped it, without removing the skin, to New York,\\r\\nwhere we got either $26 or $28 for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took the train to Kane where we stayed over night. The next\\r\\nmorning we went to camp and found all well with one exception, that\\r\\nbeing, that the shanty was swarming with \"deer mice\" and a porcupine\\r\\nhad tried hard to gnaw his way through the door. The following day we\\r\\nstayed in camp and rested before starting out to see what would turn\\r\\nup the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe first looked at the bear traps, tending what small traps came in\\r\\non the way. On going the rounds of the bear traps, we found them all\\r\\nundisturbed except one, which might better have been as it only had a\\r\\nporcupine in it and we did not see any signs of bear. We began to\\r\\nthink of taking up the bear traps as we thought that bruin had gone\\r\\ninto winter quarters. We did not get around to take them up for\\r\\nseveral days, being busy tending the smaller traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now getting along into December and the snow was quite deep.\\r\\nWe concluded to put in the time hunting deer as we wished to get all\\r\\nwe could, to send out with the team, when we had it come in, as it\\r\\ndid not cost any more to take out a full load than half a load. The\\r\\nlaw closed on deer the first of January, although allowing the\\r\\nhunters 15 days to dispose of his venison after it was unlawful to\\r\\nkill deer. We hustled from early morning until long after dark, when\\r\\nwe would get to camp and there was hardly a day that we did not kill\\r\\nat least one deer and some days two or three between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will tell of a little scrape I had one day with a yearling buck\\r\\nthat I thought to be dead. I was following the trail of three or four\\r\\ndeer along the side of a ridge, expecting every moment to catch them\\r\\nfeeding, when I heard a noise behind me and looking back, I saw this\\r\\nlittle buck coming full tilt right towards me. The deer saw me about\\r\\nas soon as I did him and wheeled to run back when I fired and he went\\r\\ndown. I set my gun against a tree and started to cut the deer\\'s\\r\\nthroat. I took the deer by the ear and straightened his back. About\\r\\nthis time that dead deer began to get pretty lively and was trying to\\r\\nget on his feet and as I could not reach my gun, threw myself onto\\r\\nhim, thinking to hold him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell I held him about as long as lightning would stay on a limb. When\\r\\nI got through gazing at the hole in the brush where I last saw him, I\\r\\nfound that I was sadly in need of a new pair of trousers and vest, as\\r\\nwell as a jack knife. I searched a long time in hopes of finding the\\r\\nknife, but did not. I had another knife at camp and after about a two\\r\\nhour\\'s job with needle and thread, I managed to get the trousers so\\r\\nthat they were passable in a pinch and all the time that I was\\r\\nrepairing the trousers, Bill sat there laughing at me. Now this was\\r\\nthe first time that I had supposed dead deer come to life and give me\\r\\nthe go-by, though it was not the last time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had given him what is called a fine shot, that is I had shot him\\r\\njust across the back and the ball had struck one of the joints or\\r\\nknuckles of the backbone as it proved. I had the satisfaction of\\r\\nkilling the same deer two or three days later or at least we thought\\r\\nit was the same one. We had three or four days of mild weather and as\\r\\nwe had not been the rounds of the traps for several days, only\\r\\ntending those that came handy while hunting deer, we thought we would\\r\\nreverse the plan and go over all the traps and pay but little\\r\\nattention to deer hunting unless we struck a hot trail. We thought we\\r\\nwould take in those traps first in the direction where the bear traps\\r\\nwere and go to the traps farthest from camp and bring in some of the\\r\\ntraps. We did not expect to get any more bear as it was too late in\\r\\nthe season for bear to travel until they had their winter\\'s sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were in luck this time for as we had usually tended the bear\\r\\ntraps, the one that we went to first would have been the last trap to\\r\\ncome to. When we came in sight of where the trap was set we saw that\\r\\nthere had been a bear dance going on. As the snow was several inches\\r\\ndeep, we saw at a glance which way the bear had gone and we only had\\r\\nto step to the brow of the ridge and look down the hillside a little\\r\\nway to see bruin fast among some small saplings. He was rolling and\\r\\ntumbling about trying to release himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked like a great black ball as he rolled about. We lost no time\\r\\nin putting him out of his trouble. We skinned the fore parts and hung\\r\\nthem up in a sapling to use for bait for fox and marten and took the\\r\\nsaddles to camp, skinned them out and stretched the skin on the\\r\\nshanty. Later we shipped the saddles to market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we looked at the balance of the bear traps but found\\r\\nthem undisturbed but we concluded to leave them set a few days\\r\\nlonger. On going the rounds of the smaller traps, we got a fox or two\\r\\nalso a marten or two, but as I remember it, we got no mink or otter\\r\\nat this time. We now had the traps all looked after, so we put in the\\r\\ntime hunting deer as the time for deer hunting was soon to close. The\\r\\nweather had turned and frozen so that it had formed a sharp crust and\\r\\nwe were compelled to use the driving method of hunting. One of us\\r\\nwould stand on the runways, in the beds of basins and in low places\\r\\non the ridges while the other would follow the trail and drive the\\r\\ndeer through to the hunter. I wish to say right here, that I do not\\r\\nlike this way of hunting deer but little better than I do of hounding\\r\\nand running deer with dogs. The dog is all right but I want no\\r\\ndogging of deer for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would get a deer nearly every day. It was now the first of January\\r\\nand time to get our venison to camp or out to the road where we could\\r\\npick them up on the way out to Kane. After we had gathered up the\\r\\nvenison and had gone the rounds of the traps that had not been tended\\r\\nwhile hunting, we went to Kane. Here we engaged a team to come in\\r\\nafter the venison and bear and bring in a grub stake to last us until\\r\\nthe middle of March when we would break camp and go home. We both\\r\\nwent back to Kane with the team to assist in getting over some of the\\r\\nrough places and see that our venison and bear meat was tagged and\\r\\nshipped all right. Then we came back to camp to put our entire time\\r\\nin tending to the traps which we did to good advantage. We had found\\r\\nother good warm springs while hunting, and some that we thought were\\r\\nlasting springs, had gone dry or had frozen up, so we shifted a good\\r\\nmany of the traps to the other springs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we took it a little easier only going the rounds of the traps as\\r\\nwe considered it necessary and on such days as the weather was\\r\\nfavorable. We waited for February when we knew that the old dog coon\\r\\nwould begin his rounds of calling on his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe managed to pass the time away fairly well as we would get a fox,\\r\\nmink, marten or something nearly every day so that we busied\\r\\nourselves. About the middle of February we had several warm days and\\r\\nthe time had now come for us to get busy and we were out as soon as\\r\\nit was light. We would follow up all the spring runs until we found\\r\\nthe trail of a coon, then follow it up until it went into a tree.\\r\\nSometimes it bothered us which tree to cut down for the coon would go\\r\\nfrom one tree to another so that it was hard to tell which was the\\r\\ntree that was the home of the coon (some call it a den). One day we\\r\\nchopped down a great large oak, three or four feet in diameter and\\r\\nnearly sound all the way through and nary a coon to be found. I asked\\r\\nBill why he did not say cuss words and he said he thought we had\\r\\nspent enough wind in chopping the tree down, without wasting any\\r\\nunnecessarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, as I said, the coon had been up and down so many trees that we\\r\\ndid not know which one was the most likely one. We went to a large\\r\\nbasswood tree that had only one track going to it and one away from\\r\\nit but when we pounded on it with the axe, we saw that it was very\\r\\nhollow. I suggested to Bill that we chop it down. Bill thought there\\r\\nwere no coon in it and I had but little faith myself but I told him\\r\\nthat as he had been wanting a wood job, here was his opportunity and\\r\\nBill agreed with me, so we laid off our coats and went to chopping.\\r\\nThe tree was only a shell. We soon had it down and to our surprise,\\r\\ncoon began to run in all directions. Not having had much hopes of\\r\\nfinding any coon in the tree we had not prepared ourselves with clubs\\r\\nto kill the coon. We used the axe handle as best we could but one\\r\\ncoon got away and went into a hollow stump which we had to cut down.\\r\\nWe got five coon. We then took up the trail of the coon that left the\\r\\ntree and after following it about a mile it went into a large hemlock\\r\\ntree that had a hole in it close to the roots. Pounding on it we\\r\\ndiscovered that it was hollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been several coon tracks both out and into the tree. We\\r\\ncircled around some distance from the tree and found no tracks\\r\\nleading away from the tree farther than a small spring a few rods\\r\\naway. As it was getting well on towards night we did not fell the\\r\\ntree but went back to the old basswood where we had left the coons\\r\\nand took them and went to camp. Bill said that he had a dash-dang\\r\\nsight rather chop wood than to tote those three coons. I carried two\\r\\nand told Bill not to complain and I would let him skin all of them\\r\\nwhen we got to camp. He said, \"Oh, you are a clever jade, aint you?\"\\r\\nWe skinned the coon that evening but did not stretch the skin until\\r\\nthe next afternoon after we had gone out and cut the hemlock and got\\r\\nthree more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe kept up this coon hunt as long as we could find any tracks. It was\\r\\nnow getting along into March and we had written home for a team to\\r\\ncome in and take our camp outfit and furs out. As we had not been out\\r\\nover the road through the woods, the way we came in, we made a trip\\r\\nout to the main wagon road so that the man who came after us would\\r\\nhave no trouble in following the trail to the camp. We now began to\\r\\nspring all the deadfalls that we had set for marten, mink and coon\\r\\nand take up all of the steel traps as we had written to the man to be\\r\\nthere about the fifteenth of the month. I think it was a day or two\\r\\nlater when the team came and our hunt on the Kinzua was ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got some thirty odd deer and either five or six bear and I think\\r\\nfour otter. I do not remember the number of fox, mink, marten and\\r\\ncoon, but we did well for there had been but very little trapping\\r\\ndone in that locality at that time and furbearing animals were quite\\r\\nplentiful. I have never been back to that camp since. I gave the camp\\r\\nto a man by the name of Ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred and the Old Trapper.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Fred, you can go with me to attend my traps, come down early as\\r\\nI wish to start at 5 o\\'clock.\" Fred was on hand next morning at the\\r\\nappointed hour. We leave the road here and go up this stream; this\\r\\nwill take us to several traps and also to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are these woods very large?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Fred. It is about fourteen miles either way through them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does any one live in them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No one only the lumberman. Well, Fred, here is the first trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see any trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but it is there, just in front of that little stone pen; the\\r\\nbait is in the pen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you take that bush away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! that is part of the knack in trapping; see that is just far\\r\\nenough from the pen to let the animal pass through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I see, and it will step in the trap in going through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is it, exactly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t the water take the brush away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if it gets too high, but you will see that I have put some\\r\\nheavy stones on the limbs that are down in the water; you also see\\r\\nthat I turn the water above the trap by throwing up a few stones;\\r\\nthis is done to keep the water so that it just covers the traps. You\\r\\nsee that bunch of leaves that are a little higher than the rest of\\r\\nthe leaves--the pan of the trap is just under those leaves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did that moss grow on the stone pen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I put it there to make the pen look old; you see a fox can\\r\\neasily step on that bunch of dry leaves that are on the pan of the\\r\\ntrap from the bank. A fox does not like new things. You see this trap\\r\\nis set for mink, coon or fox, whichever may happen along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the trap fastened to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"See that limb that has moss all grown over it. The trap is stapled\\r\\nto it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t a fox or coon drag it away?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but not far. See the chain is stapled about the middle of the\\r\\nlimb, and the animal would not go far before it got fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fred, you get that rabbit out of the knapsack that we took out of\\r\\nthe snare, and we will put some fresh bait in the pen for this is\\r\\ngetting too stale; mink and coon do not like rotten meat. Cut it into\\r\\nseveral pieces so that the animal can not get it all at once. There,\\r\\nthat is all right, and let us hurry on to the next trap. Here it is\\r\\nand a mink in it and drowned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is the pen? I do not see it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We do not always have a pen. You see that notch in that log where\\r\\nthe water runs over? That is where the trap was set. See this hay\\r\\nwire that is fastened to the trap chain and which is fastened to that\\r\\nstone out in the deep water? The mink could not go toward the bank so\\r\\nit went into the deep water and was drowned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you set a double spring trap here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Fred, an otter might happen along and that is just the place\\r\\nto catch it. You see above the log I have fixed to gage the water as\\r\\nat the other trap. I do this so the water will not wash the covering\\r\\nfrom the trap, or get so deep over the trap that the animal will not\\r\\nspring it when going over it.\" \"I see that you have got those brush\\r\\non either side of the trap with just enough space for the animal to\\r\\npass through over the trap.\" \"That is correct, you are catching on,\\r\\nFred, all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you use bait where you set a trap in this way?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not often; sometimes I fasten a fish with a horse-hair with a hook\\r\\nfast to it so that you can hook it to the lower jaw and fasten it in\\r\\nthe water just above the trap; water keeps it moving and attracts the\\r\\nanimal. We have got this trap set all right and will now move on to\\r\\nthe next. We will take the mink to the next trap before skinning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that over yonder on the other side of the creek?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a coon and it is in a trap. Fred, you take my cane and kill\\r\\nit while I fix up the bait pen, for it has torn things up as bad as a\\r\\nbear would.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you not use stones to build this pen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Old chunks are just as good and much handier to get, and there was\\r\\nplenty of moss on the old logs near to cover it with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you not use old bushy limbs here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see this trap sets in the mouth of a small spring run; we will\\r\\ncut some little twigs and stick them up in the ground, in place of\\r\\nthe brush, to make the runway, as we call it. We will now skin the\\r\\nmink. Rip straight down the hind leg from the heel to the vent. Now\\r\\nlay the knife down and start the skin loose on the legs with the\\r\\nthumb and finger; work the skin down the leg to the root of the tail\\r\\nthen take knife and cut the skin loose around the vent working the\\r\\nskin free around the roots of tail until you can get your fingers of\\r\\nthe left hand around the tail bone. Now with the right hand near the\\r\\nbody of the mink pulling with the right and you will strip the tail\\r\\nclean from the bone. With the knife make a slit on either fore leg\\r\\nabout one inch from the heel and around the leg. You are now ready to\\r\\nstrip the skin down the body to the fore legs and with the thumb and\\r\\nfinger work the leg out. Strip the skin down to the ears and with the\\r\\nknife cut the ears close to the head, continue to strip the skin down\\r\\nto the eyes, cut around the eyes close to the bone and use the knife\\r\\non down to the end of nose. That was a short job. Now we will put\\r\\nthis mink carcass in the back end of the pen and cut the balance of\\r\\nthe rabbit up and put it in the pen back about six inches from the\\r\\ntrap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you use any scent; I have heard people say that you use some\\r\\nkind of scent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I use none, only of the animal itself. It did not take long to take\\r\\nthe pelt off that coon; we will strip some of that fat from the\\r\\ncarcass and do it up in the skin and put it in the knapsack; hang the\\r\\ncarcass up on that sapling. We must be moving now. Our next trap is a\\r\\nbear trap; it sets up in that little sag you see and in a spring that\\r\\ncomes out of the side of the hill. I like to set traps in those\\r\\nsprings for they never freeze up and the bait keeps much longer. No,\\r\\nthere is nothing in it, I can see the clog there all right. Yes,\\r\\nthere is something in it; it is a coon and it is dead. Look, there is\\r\\na fox in a trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where was the trap set, I do not see any bait pen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fred, you take this stick and walk up slowly to him; go up close and\\r\\ngive him a sharp blow across the back of the neck--that will fix him.\\r\\nYou see that big mossy log laying on the bank over there? That was\\r\\nwhere he was caught. We will now set the trap again. See this little\\r\\nsink in the log? That is where the trap was set; this limb is what\\r\\nthe trap was fastened to, one end on the ground and the other comes\\r\\njust up to the log where the trap is set and we will staple the trap\\r\\nto it. We will now cover it with moss, just like on this log, but we\\r\\nwill get it from another log. No one could tell that there was a trap\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will not the fox smell it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might if it was not for this fox carcass. We will skin the fox,\\r\\njust as we did the mink. Look out there Fred, do not disturb the moss\\r\\nor anything on that log where the trap is. Keep away from that. We\\r\\nwill put this carcass in the little hollow and will drive a crotched\\r\\nstake straddle of its neck; drive it well down; now take this stick\\r\\nand rake some leaves over it, cover the neck where the stake is quite\\r\\nwell, the rest of the carcass only slightly. You have done it very\\r\\nwell and the fox will not notice what scent there is on the trap as\\r\\nlong as that carcass is there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you had no carcass there when you caught this one and I have\\r\\nheard that a fox was afraid of the scent of iron?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all bosh. Keep your traps free from all foreign scent and\\r\\nyou need not be afraid of the scent of the iron, but if you catch\\r\\nsome animal in the trap, then you should have some of the scent of\\r\\nthat animal around near the trap, this will overcome what scent there\\r\\nis on the trap. This, however, is only necessary with shy animals\\r\\nlike the fox. Coon and skunk are not afraid of what they smell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you ever wear gloves when setting your traps?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: LOG SET FOR FOX.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that is all nonsense. Get the clamps out of the knapsack and we\\r\\nwill set the bear trap. We set the trap this way so that the bear\\r\\ngoes in lengthways of the jaws, not crosswise of them. We will now\\r\\nplace the trap in this hole that we have dug out, so that the water\\r\\nwill be deep enough to cover the trap and be sure that the jaws rest\\r\\nfirmly on the ground, so that if the bear should step on the jaws,\\r\\nthe trap would not tip up. Some trappers do not do this and then they\\r\\nthink that the shy animal turned the trap over. We will now cover the\\r\\ntrap with those water soaked leaves after which we will take this\\r\\npiece of moss as large as your hand, and with this forked stick put\\r\\nthe moss on it, and place it on the pan of the trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would the bear smell it, if you put it on with your hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but if the trap should accidentally spring it would be better to\\r\\ncatch the stick than your hand. Now we will cut this coon carcass\\r\\ninto two or three pieces and put it back in the bait pen about three\\r\\nfeet from the trap. There we have it fixed all right. We will now go\\r\\nover the ridge to where there is another bear trap set and will eat\\r\\nour lunch as we go along.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you know that a fox would go on that log where that trap was\\r\\nset?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By knowing the nature of the animal. When the fox smelled the bear\\r\\nbait in the pen there, I knew that he would get on the highest point\\r\\nnear the pen to investigate and that point was that log.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the only way you catch foxes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that is only one of the many ways. Here we are; the trap is\\r\\nright down in the head of this hollow; that is a dark place down\\r\\nthere, yes, that is the kind of a place that bears like to travel\\r\\nthrough. I can see the pen, but I do not see the clog. Yes, the clog\\r\\nis gone, I guess that Bruin has put his foot in it this time. Now go\\r\\nstill and look sharp and see if we can find him anywhere for a bear\\r\\nwill try hard and get away when they first see you. He has gone this\\r\\nway, see how he has torn down the brush and has turned up those old\\r\\nlogs. He will not do that long and after a little we may be obliged\\r\\nto circle in places to find the trail. Here he has gone up this steep\\r\\nside hill but he will not go far that way. See how he has torn this\\r\\nold tree top up and gnawed those logs and those trees, he has been\\r\\npast here. He has gone straight back down the hill. Now he will keep\\r\\nalong this side hill, for he may cross this hollow back and forth\\r\\nthree or four times before we find him fast. Here is the trail again,\\r\\nhe has gone back up the hill. We will work up the hill so as to keep\\r\\non the highest ground.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have followed these bear trails a good many times, haven\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, in 1900 I followed one seven days that broke the chain and went\\r\\nup with the trap, and then another party ran across the bear and\\r\\nkilled it. I did not even get my trap back. They said they hung the\\r\\ntrap up in a tree and some one stole it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold on Fred, what is that away down there in the hollow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the bear, he is trying to climb that tree, I do not think he\\r\\nwill make it, for the clog is fast between those two small saplings\\r\\nthat stand by the large tree. We will go a little closer, there now!\\r\\nwhen he turns his head sideways take good aim and put the ball square\\r\\nin the ear. A good job, Fred, he never knew what hurt him. Now make a\\r\\nslit in the skin, right at the point of the breast bone, and then\\r\\nstick him as you would a hog. Do not cut the skin too much. Now Fred\\r\\nget the clamps out of the knapsack and we will see if we can get him\\r\\nout of the trap. Now we will skin him as you would a beef with the\\r\\nexception, we will leave the claws on, for the skins are a much\\r\\nbetter price where the feet are left. We will be very careful not to\\r\\ncut the hide, for they skin about as mean as a hog does. Well now we\\r\\nwill hang the foreparts up in this tree and take the skin and the\\r\\nsaddles and pull for camp.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not going to set the trap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it will be dark before we get to camp now and we have got a\\r\\nheavy load to carry, in fact, if it was anything but bear, we would\\r\\nthink we could not carry it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My, but this is getting heavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Fred, but this all goes in with trapping and besides it will\\r\\nimprove the appetite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess so, for I am as hungry as a wolf.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, here we are at camp. Fred, you will find the lamp on that\\r\\nshelf close up in the corner. You light it while I start the fire.\\r\\nNow Fred you will find the key to the camp chest behind that ridge\\r\\npost. Open the chest and take the blankets out so that they will be\\r\\nairing. Now in the other part of the chest you will find some tin\\r\\ncups, plates, knives and forks, also some crackers, cheese and ginger\\r\\nsnaps. The cheese is done up in waxed paper. You can put those things\\r\\non the table while I go to the spring and get a pail of water. Now,\\r\\nFred, you raise that lid and you will find a box sunk down in the\\r\\nground, where you will find potatoes and bacon. Get some out. You\\r\\nwill find the coffee in a sack in the chest and the coffee pot is\\r\\nhanging on that nail. You put the coffee on while I get the\\r\\npotatoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, we cannot wait for potatoes to cook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we can, I will pare three or four and slice them up and put\\r\\nthem in the spider with a little water and some bits of pork and by\\r\\nthe time the coffee boils, the potatoes will be ready. Fred, just\\r\\nhand me that lid so I can cover these potatoes over. You will find a\\r\\ncan of condensed milk and the sugar in the chest. Please set them on\\r\\nthe table while I fix the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have plenty of good dry wood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I always come over to the camp before the trapping season\\r\\nbegins and cut up a good lot of wood. And those old elevated stove\\r\\novens make the best kind of a stove for a camp. Fred, you pour the\\r\\ncoffee while I take the potatoes up and we will partake of this\\r\\nfrugal meal. In the morning for breakfast we will have bear steak,\\r\\nboiled partridge and buck-wheat cakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well Fred, I feel better, how is it with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I feel like a fighting cock now, but I was too hungry for\\r\\nanything. Well Fred, the dish water is hot in that pan on the stove,\\r\\nif you will wash the dishes, I will stretch those skins and dress\\r\\nthose partridges. Now if you will spread the blankets on the bunk, I\\r\\nwill mix the cakes for breakfast, and then we will be ready for bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How large is this camp?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The logs were cut fourteen and sixteen feet long, so that makes it\\r\\nabout twelve by fourteen on the inside. The roof is good and steep.\\r\\nYes, I like a ridge roof and half pitch them, you do not have to make\\r\\nthe body so high. Yes, I always chunk well and calk good with moss\\r\\nbefore I mud it, then you have a good warm camp. Yes, I like to have\\r\\na 12 x 20, two small sash in each gable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that roof leak?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, a roof put on with good hemlock bark like that will not leak and\\r\\nwill last a long time. Fred we must bunk down for we must be moving\\r\\nearly in the morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Fred, turn out, I have breakfast about ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why it is not morning, is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is six o\\'clock and we must be moving as soon as we can see,\\r\\nfor we have a big day\\'s work before us. Yes, Fred, everything tastes\\r\\ngood in the woods. I suppose a keen appetite has something to do with\\r\\nthat. Well, it is light, so that we can see to travel, so we will be\\r\\ngoing. Yes, Fred, you can come over with me again and I will show you\\r\\nhow to set traps, many different ways, to catch different animals,\\r\\nand we might have a bear in a pen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you catch bear in a pen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I like a pen for a bear better than a steel trap. No\\r\\ngetting away if the pen is properly made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, here is the bear trap and there has been a wild cat at work at\\r\\nthose inwards, so you see I did not bring that trap along for\\r\\nnothing. Fred, you place a few of those bushy limbs around on the\\r\\nupper side of those inwards, while I set the trap. There, that is all\\r\\nright, we will staple to this limb. Yes, he will be quite likely to\\r\\nget into the trap if he comes again, for he can\\'t get at the bait\\r\\nvery well from any other way, only over the trap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How far is it from where the bear trap was set?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About one-half mile. Yes, I suppose he dragged that trap three or\\r\\nfour miles to get that distance. Here we are, it will not be a long\\r\\njob to set that trap as he has not torn the bait trap down. Fred, you\\r\\nget the clamps from the knapsack, while I cut that bushy tree for a\\r\\nclog. Yes, we let those limbs stick out about ten inches so that they\\r\\nwill catch in the brush and on logs, and that bothers, you see. Yes,\\r\\nthose lungs and liver are all right for bait as long as it is fresh.\\r\\nA bear does not like tainted meat. Well, that is all right now, we\\r\\nwill go to camp and get a bite to eat, and then pull for home and get\\r\\nthe horse and wagon and come out and take the bear meat and the skin\\r\\nin. Yes, we always ship the saddles to New York, they bring a good\\r\\nprice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is more of a knack to stretch a bear skin right than any\\r\\nother skin. Here we are at camp again, we will eat a bite and then\\r\\npull for home. Good bye, Fred, yes, you shall go again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\n\\r\\nBears in 1870, To-Day--Other Notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne not familiar with the conditions of a wild woods life would\\r\\nnaturally think that bears would diminish in proportion to deer and\\r\\nwild animals. However, this does not seem to be the case. Forty years\\r\\nago, trappers of bear were not as numerous as at the present time.\\r\\nPeople at that time, hunted more for profit than sport and their\\r\\nforte was the slaughter of deer. In those days it was nothing\\r\\nuncommon to see sleigh loads of deer pass every day on the way to\\r\\nmarket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first tracking snows of the season, the deer killed in this\\r\\ncounty (Potter) were hauled by team thirty and forty miles to the\\r\\nnearest railroad station and shipped to New York and Philadelphia but\\r\\nthis is not what we wish to write of. We only speak of this to show\\r\\nthat the man of forty years ago was of the trail, rather than the\\r\\ntrap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty years ago, the writer was acquainted with nearly every hunter\\r\\nand trapper who made a business of hunting or trapping in this and\\r\\nadjoining counties. Men who made a business of trapping bear as well\\r\\nas hunting deer could be counted on the fingers of your hands, and\\r\\nthe grounds on which they operated were the counties of Clinton,\\r\\nMcKean, Cameron and Potter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of these men who perhaps were the most interested in bear\\r\\ntrapping in the section above mentioned were, Leroy Lyman, Horatio\\r\\nNelson, Lanson Stephan, Isaac Pollard, Ezery Prichard and one or two\\r\\nothers, including the writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traps mostly used were bear pens and deadfalls. It was considered\\r\\na fairly good day\\'s work for two men to build one good bear pen or\\r\\ntwo good deadfalls. Most bear trappers, however, had a few steel bear\\r\\ntraps for it may be said that nearly every country blacksmith knew\\r\\nhow to make a bear trap and how to temper a trap spring. This cannot\\r\\nbe said of the average blacksmith of the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBear forty years ago would migrate then as they do now. We used to\\r\\nthink that bear would travel from the Virginias and from Northern New\\r\\nYork if not from the New England States to Pennsylvania or from\\r\\nPennsylvania north or south as the case may be. This was proven from\\r\\nthe fact that if there was a good crop of mast in one locality, while\\r\\na scarcity in another, the bear would all seem to be moved north or\\r\\nsouth as the case may be as though they had some way of informing one\\r\\nanother where plenty of food was to be found. At such times when bear\\r\\nare on a migratory tramp it is not an uncommon thing to find a bear\\r\\ntrack near your house or barn on going out in the morning when there\\r\\nwas snow on, so that the track is plain to be seen. This was no\\r\\nuncommon thing forty years ago, neither is it at the present time\\r\\n(1910) when there is a general scarcity of forage crops such as beech\\r\\nnuts, chestnuts and acorns. I have seen it stated by some writers\\r\\nthat at certain times bear will move in a drove and at such times it\\r\\nwas not safe for a man to meet a bear for they were very dangerous\\r\\nand would attack any one who chanced to be in their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my upwards of fifty years experience of woods life, I do not call\\r\\nto mind of ever seeing more than three bears on one trail at the same\\r\\ntime and these were an old bear and cubs. It has been the writer\\'s\\r\\nobservation that when bears were on these migratory trips in search\\r\\nof food or from other cause, they travel singly and not in droves or\\r\\neven in pairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer when bears are existing on nettles, wild turnips,\\r\\nberries and other green food, it is not out of the ordinary to find a\\r\\nbear in pretty close proximity to the farm house and close around the\\r\\nfields where he can occasionally get a sheep or lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen and heard much written and said of bear raising from\\r\\ntheir hind feet to attract people\\'s attention who chanced to come in\\r\\ntheir way when in the woods. I have never seen a bear raise on his\\r\\nhind feet for battle, in any case, when a hunter or trapper\\r\\napproaches them. I have often seen them sit upon their haunches to\\r\\nlisten when they heard a noise and were not sure of its origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the number of bear at the present time and forty or fifty years\\r\\nago, through Northern and Central Pennsylvania, there seems to be\\r\\nabout as many now as there were then. This I attribute to the fact\\r\\nthat much of the country in other localities has been cleared up and\\r\\nthus deprived bruin of his natural haunts.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty years ago,--in the early 70\\'s--it was customary then as now, to\\r\\nkeep tab on trappers as to what they were doing along the trap line.\\r\\nTrappers of years ago would average from three to twelve bears,\\r\\naccording to how plenty they were and to what the condition of the\\r\\nweather was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt often happens that when bear are plenty on the trapper\\'s trapping\\r\\ngrounds, he does not have the best of luck in taking the game. If\\r\\nshack is very plentiful it is sometimes difficult to get the bear to\\r\\ntake ordinary bait. The bear will also den up or go into hibernation\\r\\nmuch quicker if they get fat, than they will if shack is a little\\r\\nscarce so that they do not get quite so fleshy. If the bears get real\\r\\nfleshy early in the season they will den up at the approach of the\\r\\nfirst cold and freezing weather and sleep until spring. On the other\\r\\nhand, if the bear continues to be a little lean, as he generally is\\r\\nduring the summer, he will continue to search for food during quite\\r\\nsevere weather. They will leave winter quarters and come out in\\r\\nsearch of food when there are a few warm days, or a slight thaw,\\r\\nwhich they will rarely do if they go into the den in good flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear is not like the raccoon. Their rutting season in this\\r\\nlatitude is in August and not in February and March as with the\\r\\nraccoon and groundhog. Now all of these conditions has much to do\\r\\nwith the number of bears that a trapper may get during a season. The\\r\\nnumber of bear taken in Pennsylvania by the average trapper at the\\r\\npresent time and forty years ago may be slightly less now than then\\r\\nbut the difference is not great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more bear trappers today than forty years ago. During the\\r\\nmonths of October and November, 1909, there were nearly one hundred\\r\\nbears caught in traps and killed with dogs in the above counties\\r\\nmentioned. Bears were more plentiful through this section than usual\\r\\nthis season, although they did not work north into the beech timber\\r\\nuntil about the first of November, owing to a heavy crop of chestnuts\\r\\nand acorns farther south.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, if I was in a section of country where\\r\\nlarge game was as plentiful as it was here fifty years ago, I would\\r\\nnot be able to get very far into tall timber, but as it gets\\r\\nmonotonous to write of skunk, muskrat and rabbit hunting of to-day, I\\r\\nwill tell of some of my experiences of fifty years ago, when it was\\r\\nmy custom to hunt deer and bear for profit and pleasure. In those\\r\\ndays I made it a point to be in the woods with my bear traps and\\r\\nrifle by the middle of October each year, if health permitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn those days all that a trapper and hunter had to do was to get a\\r\\nfew miles out into tall timber, build a good log cabin and hit a\\r\\npermanent job for the season. Deer, bear and fur-bearing animals were\\r\\nso plentiful that it only required a small territory to find game\\r\\nsufficiently plenty to keep the trapper on a lively gait all the\\r\\ntime. In those days we made it more a specialty of hunting deer for\\r\\nthe profit there was in it. We had built our cabin on the divide\\r\\nbetween the headwaters of the Cross fork of Kettel Creek and the\\r\\nheadwaters of the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning. I had built a few\\r\\ndeadfalls and bear pens for bear and also had three or four steel\\r\\nbear traps set, but beech-nuts, chestnuts and other nuts were so\\r\\nplentiful that the bear would not take meat bait and I had no other\\r\\nbait at hand. The bear would pass within a few feet of a trap and pay\\r\\nno attention to the bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow at this time, furs were so low that there was but little to be\\r\\nmade from the sale of the pelts of the fox, mink, skunk, etc. But it\\r\\nwas my custom to carry one or two steel traps in my pack sack and\\r\\nwhen I killed a deer, I would make a set or two for the fox, marten\\r\\nor fisher, whichever happened along first. As I have stated I spent\\r\\nthe greater part of my time in deer hunting. On this particular day I\\r\\nwas following a drove of four or five deer, but the wind was so\\r\\nunsteady and whirling about in puffs so that as near as I could get\\r\\nto a deer was to see his white flag, beckoning me to come on as they\\r\\njumped a log or some other object. Striking the trail of a bear that\\r\\nhad gone back and forth several times, nearly in the same place\\r\\nwithin the past three or four days, since a light snow had fallen, I\\r\\nwas satisfied that it was a bear going back and forth from his\\r\\nlodging quarters to his feeding grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I left the trail of the deer and took up the trail of the bear,\\r\\ntaking the track that I thought had been made last. I did not follow\\r\\nthe trail far, which led along the brow of the ridge, when I saw that\\r\\nthe several different bear tracks were forming into one trail and\\r\\nmaking in the direction of several large hemlock trees that had been\\r\\nturned out by the roots and lay in a jumbled up mess. I followed the\\r\\ntrail carefully until I was certain that the bear had entered the\\r\\njungle of timber. Here I worked carefully around the jam of timber\\r\\nuntil sure that the bear was in the jungle and that it would be\\r\\nimpossible for me to get near the bear. The density of brush and\\r\\nundergrowth was such that I would drive the bear out before I could\\r\\nget close enough to Bruin to get a shot at him. And this was a time,\\r\\nwhen I longed for a pard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing convinced that I could do nothing alone, I got out on one side\\r\\nof the trail the bear had made in going back and forth and watched\\r\\nuntil dark, in hopes that Bruin would come out on his way to his\\r\\nfeeding grounds. But in this I was mistaken so was obliged to give up\\r\\nthe hunt for the time being and make tracks for the shanty. My camp\\r\\nwas about five or six miles from Edgcomb Place, this being the\\r\\nnearest point to where anyone lived, where I might get help to rout\\r\\nBruin. The Edgcomb Place was a sort of a half way house, it being\\r\\nabout fourteen miles either way to a settlement. The stage made one\\r\\ntrip a week over this road and stopped at Edgcomb Place for dinner\\r\\nand often some one would come out from town in the stage and stop\\r\\nthere for a few days\\' hunt. It was one of these parties that I was in\\r\\nhopes of getting to help me out in this bear hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started in the morning before daylight as the stage had gone the\\r\\nKettel Creek way the day before, which was in my favor of catching\\r\\nhelp at the hotel. As good luck proved to be on my side, I found a\\r\\nman at the hotel by the name of John Howard, who was stopping there\\r\\nfor a few days\\' hunt. He was more than anxious to join me in the bear\\r\\nhunt. We hastened back to camp so as to get onto the job as quickly\\r\\nas possible. We got to the shanty about noon and got a hasty lunch\\r\\nand started out to wake Bruin up if he was still sleeping where I had\\r\\nleft him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got to the jam of timber, we found that he had been to his\\r\\nfeeding grounds and had returned to his lodging apartments during the\\r\\nnight, so we now thought that we would soon make sure of our game. We\\r\\nlocated the spot the best we could where we thought Bruin was\\r\\nsleeping and began to cautiously work our way in from opposite sides.\\r\\nIt only took a short time to work our way into the jam sufficiently\\r\\nto locate a large root, where Bruin\\'s tracks showed plainly that he\\r\\nwas sleeping under this root. We continued to work our way up closer\\r\\nto the root with gun in hand for ready action. But still Bruin did\\r\\nnot show up, neither could we hear the least bit of a noise from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were within a few feet of the root, Mr. Howard on one side\\r\\nand the writer on the other side, suddenly, without any warning\\r\\nwhatever, Bruin came out of his hole like a shot out of a gun and\\r\\nnearly landed on Mr. Howard, who sprang backwards to escape him. Mr.\\r\\nHoward\\'s feet became tangled in the thick brush, he fell backwards\\r\\nand before he could regain his feet, Bruin had gone over the brow of\\r\\nthe ridge, into the laurel out of sight. Mr. Howard was not able to\\r\\nget in a shot at Bruin, as I was on the other side of the root and on\\r\\nhigher ground, I managed to empty both barrels of my rifle at him\\r\\nthrough the thick brush, but Bruin went on down the hill, through the\\r\\nlaurel, apparently unhurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter following the trail of Bruin for some distance, we began, now\\r\\nand then, to find a little blood, where the bear had crawled over a\\r\\nlog or rubbed against the laurel. We followed him until we found one\\r\\nor two places where he had broken down a few laurel and scratched\\r\\nabout in trying to make a bed, so we thought the better plan was to\\r\\nlet Bruin go for the night and let him make his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we did not go to camp empty handed for good luck favored Mr.\\r\\nHoward in killing a good, big deer on our way to the shanty. After\\r\\nleaving the trail of the bear, we followed up a spur of the main\\r\\nridge that led to camp, Mr. Howard going up one side of the spur\\r\\nwhile I took the other spur. Just before reaching the top of the\\r\\nspur, I heard Mr. Howard shoot and in a few minutes I heard him\\r\\nshouting for help. When I got across the ridge to where he was, I\\r\\nfound him dressing a good sized buck. As it was getting dark we lost\\r\\nno time in taking the entrails out of the deer, cutting a withe with\\r\\na hook, which we hooked into the lower jaw of the deer. We hooked\\r\\nourselves to the withe and made lively tracks to the shanty, where we\\r\\ncould talk and laugh of the day\\'s hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were up early the next morning and had our lunch packed in our\\r\\nknapsack, ready for an early start. It had turned warm during the\\r\\nnight and the light snow that was on the ground, was fast\\r\\ndisappearing. So we lost no time in getting back to where we had left\\r\\nBruin\\'s track the night before. We could still manage to follow the\\r\\ntrail on the snow and we soon found where Bruin had broken down a few\\r\\nlaurel and tried to make a bed. But he would not stop long,\\r\\napparently, when he would move on for a short distance and again\\r\\nbreak down a few laurels as before to make a nest. We could see a\\r\\nlittle more blood at each place where he stopped than the one before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were working the trail as cautious as we could, when we heard a\\r\\nnoise in the thick laurel to our left and got a glimpse of Bruin\\r\\ngoing through the laurel. We emptied both barrels of our guns in the\\r\\ndirection where we could see the brush wiggle, but all of our shots\\r\\nfailed to take effect. Bruin now left this laurel patch, crossed a\\r\\nravine and began to climb another spur of the main ridge. We did not\\r\\nfollow the trail long, when we discovered that it was becoming hard\\r\\nwork for Bruin to travel far at a time, as he would stop to rest. The\\r\\nsnow was now gone so that it was a little more difficult to follow\\r\\nthe trail of the bear. We thought that it would be better for one of\\r\\nus to go up the ravine to the top of the ridge and stand about where\\r\\nhe thought that the bear would come out at the top of the ridge. Mr.\\r\\nHoward went to the ridge, while I was to follow the bear\\'s trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting long enough to give Mr. Howard time to get to the top\\r\\nof the ridge, I took up the trail of the bear. I had not gone far\\r\\nwhen I came to a bed, where the bear had stopped for a time. I was\\r\\nnow sure Mr. Howard would get to his watching place before the bear\\r\\nreached the top of the hill. I was not mistaken, for it was not long\\r\\nuntil I heard Mr. Howard fire both barrels of his gun in rapid\\r\\nsuccession. I thought when I heard the two shots that the bear hunt\\r\\nwas surely over, but after listening a few moments and hearing\\r\\nnothing from Mr. Howard I was then unable to give a guess what he had\\r\\ndone. I worked along on the trail until near the top of the hill when\\r\\nI saw Mr. Howard standing with head down and bearing the expression\\r\\nof a motherless colt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got up to him he said that the bear had stopped near the brow\\r\\nof the ridge and when he came in sight, the bear started across the\\r\\nridge and he fired both barrels of his rifle at him but the bear was\\r\\nso far away that he could not reach him. The bear now crossed the\\r\\nridge in the direction of Windfall Run, a branch of the Cross Fork\\r\\nand toward a large windfall. We followed the bear a short distance in\\r\\nto the windfall. Briers and brush were so thick that it was almost\\r\\nimpossible to work our way along in the brush and one could scarcely\\r\\nsee ten feet ahead. We had followed the trail but a short distance\\r\\nwhen we could hear Bruin whining like a little puppy and soon we\\r\\ncould see him sitting up on his haunches and keeping up the whine. We\\r\\nsoon put an end to his troubles. When we removed the bear\\'s entrails,\\r\\nwe found that one of the shots that we fired at him at the beginning\\r\\nof the hunt, had passed through the lungs but had not struck any\\r\\nlarge artery or any vital point. But the wound had weakened him so\\r\\nthat he was no longer able to make his way through the thick briars\\r\\nand brush. We had two days of sport but now the real work began.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were about three miles from camp and any hunter who has toted a\\r\\nthree hundred pound bear or a good big deer, lashed to a pole and\\r\\nwhere the route was up and down steep hills, knows what sort of a job\\r\\nhe has on his hands. But comrades, we were not as old at that time as\\r\\nwe now are and we could tote a bear or deer as easy then as we could\\r\\na rabbit now.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS CATCH, FALL 1904.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Howard stayed with me for about two weeks and we had other bear\\r\\nhunts and killed two other bear and we did it almost without knowing\\r\\nthat there was a bear within ten miles of us. We also got five or six\\r\\ndeer during Mr. Howard\\'s stay with me. Deer were as plentiful in\\r\\nthose days as rabbits. Comrades, look over the accompanying picture\\r\\nand note the difference at the camp of a trapper from what you can\\r\\nimagine it was about one\\'s hunting camp at the time we write of.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncidents Connected with Bear Trapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years ago, I was trapping for bears on the East Fork of the\\r\\nSinnemahoning River. I usually went on horse back as far as I could\\r\\nwhen tending the traps. But boys, don\\'t be bad, as I was, for this\\r\\nwas on Sunday that I went to look at the traps. I found the bait-pen\\r\\nof the first one torn down, bait gone and everything showed plainly\\r\\nthat Bruin had been there. As I had no bait at hand, I went to the\\r\\nnext trap. I found things quite different, for the old bear had\\r\\nsurely \"put his foot in it\" this time, as the trap was gone. On\\r\\ntaking the trail I did not follow it far, before I found bruin fast\\r\\nin an old tree-top. I soon dispatched him and taking off his coat,\\r\\nhung up his carcass. Now the bait was gone at this trap also. Let me\\r\\ntell you that this is something that rarely happens, for when the\\r\\nbear puts his foot in a Newhouse trap, he seldom tarries to monkey\\r\\nwith bait. I suspected that another bear had been there after this\\r\\none had got in the trap. As I had no bait I took the lungs and heart\\r\\nof the one I had caught and baited the traps the best I could, then I\\r\\ntook the skin and started for home. Well, when I got near the horse\\r\\nyou can bet there was some tall prancing and loud snorting. After a\\r\\nlong time I managed to get on his back and home with the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning I began to have some doubt whether bears were\\r\\ncannibals or not. I thought I would take some fresh bait and go back\\r\\nand bait the traps up good.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got near the trap in which I had caught the bear the day\\r\\nbefore, I heard a great deal of wrestling going on and it did not\\r\\ntake long to see that I had an old he-bear hung up this time. And now\\r\\nwas the time that I began to realize what a boy\\'s trick I had cut up,\\r\\nfor I had not taken any gun with me; only a small revolver and three\\r\\ncartridges. I found that the bear was dead fast and a big one too. He\\r\\nseemed to be more inclined to quarrel than bears usually are. I took\\r\\nmy trapping hatchet in one hand and revolver in the other, and worked\\r\\nmy way up close as I dared and awaited the best chance I could get to\\r\\nshoot for he was rolling and tumbling like a ball. I fired at his\\r\\nhead but missed it. I fired the two remaining cartridges just back of\\r\\nthe fore-shoulders. He paid about as much attention to it as I\\r\\nimagine he would if it had been a flea that bit him. After waiting\\r\\nsome time to see what effect the shots would have and noticing no\\r\\nchange in Bruin\\'s countenance, I concluded I would see what I could\\r\\ndo with a club. I soon found that I and the club were not \"in it,\" so\\r\\nI gave it up as a bad job and went home after the team and a gun. On\\r\\nmy way home I had to pass the house of an old trapper by the name of\\r\\nStevens. Of course, he was out to see what luck I had, and when I\\r\\ntold him my story, he gave a great laugh and said he would go and let\\r\\nthe bear out of the trap. When we got back to the trap the next day\\r\\nwe found the fight all gone out of Bruin, for the two shots had\\r\\npenetrated the lungs and he was nearly dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nPard, whom I call Co, and I went camping many years ago on a branch\\r\\nof the Susquehanna River in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. At that\\r\\ntime all that part of the country was an unbroken wilderness and we\\r\\nwere several miles from the nearest town. Now Co was a good hunter\\r\\nbut despised trapping, saying it was no gentleman\\'s sport, yet he was\\r\\nalways ready to do his share in camp life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening in December Co did not turn up at dark, the usual hour\\r\\nfor his return, still I did not worry much until eight o\\'clock, but\\r\\nfrom that time until about nine I kept going to the door and giving\\r\\nan occasional \"Kho-Hoop,\" just to let him know the direction of the\\r\\ncamp if he was within ear shot. As Co did not return, about nine\\r\\no\\'clock I shouldered my rifle and started out in the direction that\\r\\nhe had gone, shooting off my gun, and occasionally letting out a\\r\\nshout that echoed from hill to hill, but no answer came back in\\r\\nreply. The weather was growing extremely cold and I began to feel\\r\\nvery much worried about Co for although I knew he was a good\\r\\nwoodsman, I imagined all sorts of calamities had befallen him. At\\r\\nevery high point I would fire my gun but never an answer could I\\r\\nhear. I kept this up till midnight, and then retraced my steps to\\r\\ncamp intending to take an early start in the morning, when I could\\r\\nsee to track my wandering partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge of my delight, when about half a mile from camp the sharp\\r\\nreport of a rifle rang out on the clear night air, and I knew Pard\\r\\nhad returned alive. I hastened to the shanty where I found Co all\\r\\nright but as mad as a hornet. As he raved around he exclaimed: \"No\\r\\none but a--fool would catch anything in a--steel trap. If you must\\r\\ntrap things, get them in something that will stay put.\" When Co\\r\\ncooled off a little, I said: \"Come old man, tell us what has\\r\\nhappened.\" \"What has happened,\" said he, \"enough has happened, I\\r\\nshould think. I went where you set that tarnal old bear trap and some\\r\\ncritter has got into it and broken the chain and carried it off, and\\r\\nhe makes a track bigger than an elephant. He\\'s making for the big\\r\\nwindfall and I followed him more than forty miles, and he was farther\\r\\nahead of me than when I started, and I hope he will get into the old\\r\\nwindfall and stay there till doomsday.\" Well, Pard felt better when\\r\\nhe had eaten the hot supper I had left for him and we turned in for a\\r\\nfew hours\\' sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we went to town and got a number of men and dogs and the\\r\\nfollowing morning started out early on the track of old bruin. We\\r\\nsoon struck the trail and located the beast in a big ravine.\\r\\nStationing the men around where the bear was likely to break cover, I\\r\\nwent in with the dogs to drive him out.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there was one young chap among the crowd called Dan, who proved\\r\\nto be of rather a timid nature. The battle which soon followed proved\\r\\nvery short owing to the number of guns opened on the bear the moment\\r\\nhe broke cover and he was soon dispatched and nearly as soon skinned\\r\\nand cut up. But when I looked for Dan he was nowhere to be found. A\\r\\nsearching party was organized and after beating the bush for some\\r\\ntime, poor, frightened Dan was finally located in the top of a small\\r\\nbeech tree and came tumbling down inquiring if the bear was \"sure\\r\\ndead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nI have often thought I would like to relate some of my experiences in\\r\\nthe woods while deer hunting. Many a time while following a herd of\\r\\ndeer or a wounded one over ridge after ridge, has the sun set and the\\r\\nstars come out and I found myself many miles from my cabin or any\\r\\nhabitation. Then I would find a large fallen tree, that laid close to\\r\\nthe ground, gather a pile of dry limbs and bark, scrape away the snow\\r\\nfrom the log, often the snow being a foot deep, build a fire where I\\r\\nscraped the snow away. When the ground became thoroughly warm, I\\r\\nwould rake the coals and brands down against the log, put on more\\r\\nwood, and then I would place hemlock boughs on the ground, where I\\r\\nhad previously had the fire. Soon they would begin to steam and after\\r\\nfrizzling some venison (if I chanced to have it) before the fire I\\r\\nwould take off my coat, lie down on my stomach, pull the coat over my\\r\\nhead and shoulders and sleep for hours before waking. Sometimes I\\r\\nwould have the skin of a bear to put over me, and for doing these\\r\\nthings my friends would scold me, but the reader will know, if he has\\r\\nthe blood of a hunter in him, that I enjoyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not what I started to write about, it was of a day\\'s hunt\\r\\nafter a bear on the 16th day of December, 1903. On the day previous,\\r\\nthe afternoon sun sinking to rest in the west, casts its rays for a\\r\\nmoment upon a solitary hunter\\'s cabin in the hills of old Potter,\\r\\nthen the bright glows faded away, the sun disappeared behind the\\r\\nmountains and it was a soft beautiful twilight, while I stood just\\r\\noutside the cabin door meditating. Mart (that is an old liner who had\\r\\ncome to my cabin to have a few days\\' hunt) came out of the cabin and\\r\\nI said, \"old man, what are you thinking about?\" The reply was, \"just\\r\\nwatching the sun set.\" \"Don\\'t you think the coon will be out tonight\\r\\nif it holds warm?\" \"I don\\'t know what the coon will do, but I know we\\r\\nwent around a bear over in that jam in Dead Man\\'s Hollow. (This\\r\\nhollow is so called because a fisherman a few years ago, found the\\r\\nbody of a man who had gotten lost and died in the snow the winter\\r\\nbefore).\\r\\n\\r\\nWell what do you think you will do about it? I think we had better\\r\\nturn in early so as to get an early start in the morning and see if\\r\\nwe can find where the bear is sleeping. \"Agreed,\" said Mart, and we\\r\\nwere soon in bed, but it was a long time before I closed my eyes in\\r\\nsleep for I was familiar with the woods in the neighborhood where the\\r\\nbear was supposed to be and I mapped out and laid every plan that was\\r\\nto be carried out the next day before I went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt four o\\'clock in the morning we were astir and soon breakfast was\\r\\nready and eaten, lunch put up and at the break of day we were on our\\r\\nway to where bruin was supposed to be, a distance of about five\\r\\nmiles, which is no small job for an old cripple like myself. After\\r\\nabout three hours we were on the ground where we were in hopes of\\r\\nfinding bruin. Mart was to circle several points outside of where we\\r\\nthought the bear was snoozing; this was done to make sure that the\\r\\nbear was in there. I took a position where the bear was most likely\\r\\nto come out if he was there and should be started by Mart. My\\r\\nposition was in an open piece of timber on the point of a hill and\\r\\nnear a very thick jam of trees that had been broken down two years\\r\\nbefore by a heavy ice storm and near the bear track where he had gone\\r\\nin several days before. Mart was to make another circle somewhat\\r\\nsmaller than the one he had previously made for we now knew that the\\r\\nbear was in the jam of timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing the second circle Mart was to drop below the jam\\r\\nwhere we were quite sure bruin was napping and work his way through\\r\\nthe fallen timber. This worked all right, for soon I heard Mart cry\\r\\nout: \"Look out, he is coming.\" Soon I heard the crashing of the brush\\r\\nand could tell that bruin was coming directly toward me, and in\\r\\nanother minute he broke into the open timber. My rifle was already\\r\\npointed in that direction and bruin had scarcely made two jumps in\\r\\nthe open timber when I fired. The bear made a loud noise like that of\\r\\na hog and I knew that he was hit hard and could already see a crimson\\r\\nstreak in the snow. But bruin steadily held his course, in a few\\r\\nyards further he made an attempt to jump a large fallen tree and I\\r\\nfired again. This shot was more fatal than the first, and he fell to\\r\\nthe ground and could not rise. I hurried up and fired a shot through\\r\\nhis head which soon quieted him. Mart was soon on the scene and after\\r\\na little rejoicing we soon had his hide off, and cutting the fore\\r\\nparts off and hanging them in a tree to be brought out the next day.\\r\\nMart took the saddles and I the skin and started for camp, which we\\r\\nreached shortly before dark, and as we had prepared things for supper\\r\\nbefore leaving in the morning, supper was soon ready which consisted\\r\\nof buckwheat cakes, wild honey, baked potatoes, bacon, bear steak and\\r\\ntea. Dear readers, do not tell Mart, but I think that he took a hot\\r\\ntoddy after talking the hunt over and over. Again, we laid down to\\r\\nrest our weary selves and dream of the hunt which may never come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nPacific Coast Trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I am always looking for taller timber to plant my traps in and as\\r\\nthe drift of the trapper seems to be to the west, the Rockies and the\\r\\nPacific Coast, and as I have had some experience in the Rockies, and\\r\\nalong the Pacific Coast region, I will speak of some of the\\r\\nadvantages and disadvantages that the trapper will meet with in that\\r\\nsection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trapper will find the fur bearers more plentiful and many more\\r\\nkinds of animals to take, than is found in the East, which is a great\\r\\nadvantage to the trapper. The hunter will find deer quite plentiful\\r\\nin many places in the Rocky Mountains and on the Pacific Coast. In\\r\\n1904 I was in Humboldt and Trinity Counties, California and I found\\r\\ndeer so plentiful and tame that it was no sport to shoot them. While\\r\\nthe law limited the hunter to two deer in a season, the people in the\\r\\nmountains made their own laws, as to the number of deer that they\\r\\nshould kill. Black and brown bear are plentiful all through the Rocky\\r\\nMountains and in the Coast ranges. You see much written of the\\r\\ngrizzly bear in this region, but it is doubtful if a hunter or\\r\\ntrapper would see one or even the track of one during a whole\\r\\nseason\\'s trapping. The trapper will find marten, fisher and lynx in\\r\\nmany places in the Rockies and in the Coast Range but nothing to what\\r\\nthere was a few years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow one who is contemplating trapping in the Rockies or on the\\r\\nPacific Coast, must bear in mind that the conditions that a trapper\\r\\nmeets with in this region are far different from what they are in the\\r\\nEast. The trapper who is planning a trip in that section before\\r\\nstarting out should examine his feet close to see that there are no\\r\\ntender spots on them. The man who makes a success of trapping in this\\r\\nregion must be a man who can stand grief and hardships a plenty, for\\r\\nhe will run up against it often. He will find the mountain streams\\r\\nhard to get along; he will have but little use for a boat as the\\r\\nstreams are rapid and full of boulders. In most cases the trapper\\r\\nwill be compelled to take his outfit into the mountains by pack\\r\\nhorses, and in many cases it will be necessary for the trapper to be\\r\\nthe horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trapper to succeed in a financial way must take in a supply of\\r\\nprovisions to last at least until the first of June, for it is during\\r\\nApril, May and even June that he must do his bear trapping; for the\\r\\nbear holes up or goes into hibernation down in the lower land and\\r\\ndoes not show up much in the mountains until spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trapper must provide himself with a good number of traps of\\r\\ndifferent sizes from the No. 1 for marten to the No. 5 for bear; and\\r\\nthat means a whole lot of packing and hard work. He must have at\\r\\nleast one pair of snow shoes, and should have an extra pair in case\\r\\nof a mishap, in the way of breakage. One good gun is all that is\\r\\nlikely to be needed, and don\\'t load yourself down with a lot of\\r\\nrevolvers, hunting knives, etc. A good strong pocket knife is all\\r\\nthat I have found necessary, though one should have more than one\\r\\nknife no matter what kind he may use.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I will say a word as to a gun especially for the trap line. The\\r\\nmanufacturers of guns have as yet failed to make it. The Marble\\r\\nGame-Getter comes the nearest to it of any now made, but that is not just\\r\\nto my liking. We would do away with one of the barrels, and have a\\r\\nsingle barrel, 44 caliber straight cut, with cartridges for both ball\\r\\nand shot with 15 inch barrel, skeleton stock, similar to the Stevens\\r\\nPocket shot gun. Mind, I am speaking of an arm on purpose for the\\r\\ntrap line, and this kind of a gun would do the work and be light to\\r\\ncarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the expense for an outfit to go into the mountains for a season\\'s\\r\\ncampaign is necessarily a considerable item. It is quite necessary\\r\\nthat the trapper has a number of camps on his line at advantageous\\r\\npoints, for the trapper cannot cover sufficient territory from one\\r\\ncamp to make it pay; besides, a number of camps on the line will\\r\\nrelieve the trapper of much hardship. I mention this matter thinking\\r\\nit might be of some interest to some one whose feet are itching to\\r\\nget into a big game country, and are thinking of only the game, and\\r\\nnot of the hardships they are sure to meet with. Another thing that\\r\\nis well for the trapper who is looking for a happy hunting and\\r\\ntrapping ground to remember is, that he will no longer find game as\\r\\nplentiful as it once was, in any place that is in any way easily\\r\\naccessible. If the trapper will take into consideration the expense\\r\\nand hardship that one must put up with in going on one of these\\r\\noutings, it might be that he can find quite as much pleasure and\\r\\nprofit in looking up a trapping ground nearer home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will mention one or two places where one can find some sport where\\r\\nit will not require the hardship nor expense, and at the same time\\r\\nwill find deer and some other game quite plentiful, with a fair\\r\\nsprinkling of the fur bearers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Humboldt County, in California, on Redwood River, deer and bear\\r\\ncan be found quite plentiful, and there are some marten, fisher and a\\r\\nfew lynx, coon, mink, skunk and fox. The fox are mostly grey and you\\r\\nmay by chance meet occasionally with a mountain lion. To reach this\\r\\nsection the best way is from San Francisco by boat to Eureka, then by\\r\\nrail and wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother section where game and fur bearers are fairly plentiful and\\r\\nof easy access, is in the vicinity of Thompson\\'s Falls, in Northern\\r\\nMontana.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if only a good outing is wanted, that can be had in Pecos Valley,\\r\\nNew Mexico. You will not find much to trap other than muskrats and\\r\\ncoon on the river and lakes, but they are quite plentiful, especially\\r\\nthe latter. You will find coyotes and some grey wolves, and some\\r\\nantelope, which are protected. Duck shooting is good, the climate is\\r\\nmild, only freezing ice the thickness of window glass in the coldest\\r\\nweather, which is all thawed out and gone by ten o\\'clock. This\\r\\nsection is easily reached by rail.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, 1902, I was spending a few days at Spokane, Wash. Nearly\\r\\nevery day I would take an old cane fish pole and go to the river just\\r\\nabove the falls and fish for bass. I would shift my post from one\\r\\npoint along the bank of the river to another and sometimes I would go\\r\\nout on the boom timbers and fish among the logs. Some days I would\\r\\nget a bass or two, but oftener I got nothing further than the\\r\\npleasure of drowning a few minnows.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly every morning I noticed a man would come down along the bank\\r\\nof the river and go in the direction of the mill. Sometimes he would\\r\\nstop and watch me for a few minutes, and then pass on without saying\\r\\nanything. But one morning he came along when I happened to be sitting\\r\\nclose to his path. I looked up and gave the usual morning nod. The\\r\\ngentleman, for such he proved to be, inquired what luck I was having.\\r\\nI replied that I guessed it must be fisherman\\'s luck, for I got but\\r\\nfew fish. He replied that he thought that there were very few bass in\\r\\nthe dam, as there was so much fishing done there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was quite sure that he was right from the number of fish I caught,\\r\\nand I could see a number of others scattered about the pond, and some\\r\\non the logs, some on the boom timbers and some in boats. The next\\r\\nmorning I was back at my old post, and this man came along as usual.\\r\\nHe stopped, laughed and said that I seemed to have plenty of faith. I\\r\\nreplied that the occasion demanded great faith. He inquired if I\\r\\nlived in the city. I told him that I lived in Pennsylvania and was\\r\\nonly out in that country to see the sights and get a few fish and a\\r\\nlittle venison and later might try to get a little fur.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe informed me that his name was Nettel (Charles Nettel) that he was\\r\\na lumber inspector and that he was going to have a vacation the next\\r\\nweek. He intended going to the North Fork of the Clearwater on Elk\\r\\nCreek, where he had a camp, and that if I wished to fill up on trout\\r\\nand venison, I had better join him, as he had no one selected to\\r\\naccompany him yet. I said, \"Thank you, I would be pleased to do so,\"\\r\\nas quick as I could, for fear he would change his mind. I now dropped\\r\\nmy bass fishing and would drop into the mill where Mr. Nettel was at\\r\\nwork and catch a few minutes chat with my new-found friend, as an\\r\\nopportunity would occur, until the time came to go to Mr. Nettel\\'s\\r\\ncamp. As I had a complete outfit, including blankets, tin plates,\\r\\ncups, knives, and forks, a takedown or folding stove with the\\r\\nnecessary cooking utensils, which I had not yet unpacked, we\\r\\nconcluded to take the whole kit along so that if anything had\\r\\nhappened at Mr. Nettel\\'s camp we would have a tent as well as the\\r\\nother camp outfit, but we found Mr. Nettel\\'s shack all right. We took\\r\\na train to near a place called Orofino on the Clearwater River in\\r\\nIdaho where we repacked our outfit, putting it into sacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe engaged a man with two pack horses to take our plunder to camp\\r\\nwhich we found to be all right, and I wish to say that this was the\\r\\nfarthest up the gulch in the Rockies that I had been at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found my friend all right on the trout question, for trout were so\\r\\nplenty it was no sport to catch them. The next morning after we were\\r\\nin camp we climbed to what Mr. Nettel called the bench, but I thought\\r\\nit was the moon. We had hardly got to the level, or bench, when we\\r\\nsay plenty of elk tracks so we followed in the direction in which the\\r\\nfresh trails seemed to lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not gone far when I noticed something moving in the\\r\\nunderbrush, which might have been taken for a rocking chair for all\\r\\nthat I could tell. We stood still a few moments when three elk came\\r\\nout in sight. We watched them feed for a few minutes, then made a\\r\\nnoise like a deer blowing, and the elk stopped feeding, stood and\\r\\nlistened and looked about for danger; Mr. Nettel again snorted and\\r\\nthe elk trotted off.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now separated a little and began walking across the bench. We had\\r\\nnot gone far when I saw two buck deer feeding and shot one of them.\\r\\nMr. Nettel soon came to me and we took the entrails out of the deer\\r\\nand drew the carcass down to camp where we sure had venison as well\\r\\nas trout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who packed our outfit up the gulch for us had a little\\r\\nwhiffet dog with him, and in some manner he neglected to take the dog\\r\\nback with him. We were a little worried at first because the man had\\r\\nleft the dog with us, but later I at least was pleased that the dog\\r\\nwas with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had dressed the deer and hung the meat up on trees near the shack.\\r\\nThe second night after we had the deer hanging up, along in the night\\r\\nthe dog kept growling so that after a time, as the moon was shining,\\r\\nI thought I would get up and see what was worrying the pup. When I\\r\\nopened the shack door the pup lit out like shot from a shovel, and I\\r\\ncould see the outline of some animal taking up a tree. I could hear\\r\\nthe bark from the tree falling to the ground like hail.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Nettel was still sound asleep, so I said nothing but took my gun\\r\\nand stepped outside the shack. I could see the outlines of something\\r\\nstanding on a limb of the tree. I took the best aim I could owing to\\r\\nthe dim light and fired. The tree stood on the side of the gulch,\\r\\nwhich was very steep, and when the gun cracked the object in the tree\\r\\napparently flew right up the side of the gulch from the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pup gave chase and within fifty yards I could again hear the bark\\r\\nfrom the tree and soon again I could see the outline of the animal on\\r\\nthe tree. I was working along out towards the pup, when Mr. Nettel,\\r\\nclose to my side said, \"It is a lion; be careful and take good aim\\r\\nthis time and kill him, if you can.\" I got up to the tree where I\\r\\ncould see the cat fairly fell, and with all the care possible, I\\r\\nfired. The cat lit out from the tree, but this time he went down the\\r\\nhill instead of up, and when he struck the ground it was broadside\\r\\ninstead of on all fours. As good luck would have it, I had hit him\\r\\nsquare through the shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat was a little over seven feet long, and Mr. Nettel said that\\r\\nit was not a large lion, but as it was the first one that I had seen\\r\\nthen I thought it was longer than a twelve-foot rail. We pulled the\\r\\ncat up to the shack and turned in again. It was only eleven o\\'clock\\r\\nand Mr. Nettel was soon sound asleep, but I had too much cat\\r\\nexcitement for me to do any more sleeping that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning we skinned the cat, gathered dry leaves and stuffed\\r\\nthe skin and had a stuffed cat in camp. Later, we sold the skin to a\\r\\nparty for three dollars. We stayed in camp two weeks, feasting on\\r\\nvenison, trout, grouse, and other game. Some of the time we spent\\r\\nprospecting for gold, but we failed to strike it rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the two weeks allotted Mr. Nettel, he was obliged to\\r\\nreturn to his work, and I can say that I never spent two weeks\\' time\\r\\nwith more pleasure than I did with the friend I found while fishing\\r\\nfor bass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Michigan Trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to the recent fires (1905) in the northern portion of Michigan,\\r\\nwhich have undoubtedly killed many of the smaller fur bearing animals\\r\\nin that section, has called to mind experiences I had trapping and\\r\\nhunting in both the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of that state. In the\\r\\nfall of 1868 on the first of October, a party of four of us took a\\r\\nboat at Buffalo, New York, and went to Alpena on Thunder Bay,\\r\\nMichigan, where we purchased provisions for a winter\\'s campaign\\r\\nhunting and trapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe engaged a team to take our outfit up the Thunder Bay River, a\\r\\ndistance of about twenty miles, where the road ended. The road was an\\r\\nold lumber road and rather rough over those long stretches of\\r\\ncorduroy. We camped at the end of the lumber road the first night and\\r\\nthe team returned home the next morning. We took our knapsacks with\\r\\nsome blankets and grub and went up the river to find a camping ground\\r\\nto suit our notion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jones and myself took the one axe that we carried with us and\\r\\nbegan clearing a site to build the camp on. Mr. Goodsil and Mr.\\r\\nVanater went back after more of the supplies, which included another\\r\\ngood axe and a crosscut saw. They cut out a road as they returned so\\r\\nthat we could drive to camp when it became necessary. At the end of a\\r\\nweek we had up a good log cabin, and all was ready to begin to slay\\r\\nthe deer and skin the fur bearers. Two of the boys now went down to\\r\\nAlpena to get the mail and send letters home. On the boys\\' return\\r\\nnext day they brought word that we would not be allowed to ship any\\r\\ndeer out of the state. This put a wry face on Goodsil and Jones, for\\r\\ndeer hunting was their delight. It was not so bad with Vanater and\\r\\nmyself, for we could find plenty of sport with the traps and tanning\\r\\na few deer skins. Vanater was an expert at it, graining the skins in\\r\\nthe water and using the brains of the deer and coon oil for tanning\\r\\nand then smoking the skins.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not kill many deer though they were plentiful, but venison was\\r\\nso cheap in Detroit and other Michigan cities that it did not pay one\\r\\nfor the trouble. By the last of October there was quite a fall of\\r\\nsnow and Mr. Goodsil, who was a gunsmith, suddenly came to the\\r\\nconclusion that he was neglecting his business at home and we could\\r\\nnot persuade him to stay any longer. It was only a few days later\\r\\nwhen Mr. Jones also concluded that he was neglecting his business and\\r\\nleft us. Now I began to wonder if Mr. Vanater or myself would be the\\r\\nnext to get the home fever, but knowing the metal Charley was made\\r\\nof, I expected that I would be attacked first.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharley and I being now left alone began building deadfalls for mink,\\r\\nmarten, fisher and lowdowns for bear. I will explain that a lowdown\\r\\nis one of those affairs, half pen, half deadfall, which are built by\\r\\nfirst making a bed of small poles, then placing on this bed notched\\r\\ntogether the same as for a log house. The logs should be about twelve\\r\\ninches in diameter, and two tiers will make the pen high enough. The\\r\\nspace inside the pen is usually made about seven feet long, two feet\\r\\nhigh and twenty inches wide. The roof is made of poles or small logs\\r\\npinned to cross logs, the one at the back end of the pen forming a\\r\\nroller hinge. The cover is raised up and fastened with the usual\\r\\nlever and hook trigger, which the bait is fastened to. The bear in\\r\\norder to get the bait goes over the logs into the pen. I wish to say\\r\\nthat while this sort of a trap is quickly made, I do not like them,\\r\\nas the bear will rub the fur madly in its struggles, and they are an\\r\\ninhuman sort of an affair at best.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: BUILDING A BEAR \"LOWDOWN.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get back to my story, Charley and I did fairly well in catching\\r\\nmink and marten, but the bear had either migrated or gone into winter\\r\\nquarters. The coon had also gone into winter quarters. The snow was\\r\\ngetting quite deep as it was now past the middle of November, and it\\r\\nnow proved to be my luck to be left alone in camp. One night when we\\r\\nwere coming to camp, we had to cross a stream on a small tree which\\r\\nhad fallen across the creek. There were several inches of snow on the\\r\\nlog and Charley was carrying a small deer on his back. I was behind\\r\\nhim carrying the guns. Charley worked his way carefully across the\\r\\nlog but just as he was about to step off the log on the opposite bank\\r\\nhe slipped and fell striking his left leg across the log, breaking\\r\\nthe bone just above the ankle joint. Fortunately we were only a short\\r\\ndistance from camp so that Charley hobbled to camp, using his gun for\\r\\na crutch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got in camp it did not take long to see that the bone was\\r\\nbroken. I fixed wood, water and food as convenient as possible for\\r\\nCharley and took a lantern, a lunch in my pocket and started for\\r\\nAlpena, reaching there shortly after daylight the next morning.\\r\\nEngaging a team without any delay we started back to camp. Reaching\\r\\ncamp about three o\\'clock in the afternoon, we found Charley quite\\r\\ncomfortable and feeling quite chipper under the circumstances. While\\r\\nthe team was eating we fixed both blankets on the straw and a\\r\\nmattress which we had brought for the purpose from town, and fixed\\r\\nthings as comfortable as we could. We were soon on our way back to\\r\\ntown, which we reached about midnight. The next morning the doctor\\r\\nset the broken limb with but little difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter staying two or three days and making arrangements with a young\\r\\nman to come to camp every Saturday and bring mail and word from\\r\\nCharley, I returned to camp, where I found things all right. While\\r\\nout to town I bought a pair of snow shoes. I had never used them, and\\r\\nfor the first few days it was who and who to know which would be on\\r\\ntop, myself or the snow shoes. I finally mastered them and found them\\r\\na great help in getting about in the deep snow. It kept me pretty\\r\\nbusy attending to the traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night after Charley had been gone about three weeks, on nearing\\r\\ncamp, I saw a big smoke coming out of the chimney. I first thought\\r\\nthe cabin was on fire, but I soon saw that that was not the case, and\\r\\nknew some one had started a fire. When I got there I saw some one had\\r\\nbeen there with a team. When I rapped on the door Charley called out,\\r\\n\"Come in, I am running this camp now.\" Well, I tell you I was pleased\\r\\nto hear that voice call out, \"Come in.\" It was some time before we\\r\\nthought it best for Charley to go out very much, but he could keep\\r\\ncamp and I had company. We stayed in camp until the middle of May,\\r\\nthinking that we would have a big catch of bear in the spring, but\\r\\nwere disappointed for we only caught three; but we caught quite a lot\\r\\nof coon. We did not trap any for muskrat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy next trip to Michigan was to Kalkaska County, and I had two\\r\\npartners, Moshier and Funk by name, and both were residents of the\\r\\nstate. Our camp was on the Manistee River near the Crawford and\\r\\nKalkaska County line. This trip was some ten or twelve years later\\r\\nthan the one previously mentioned, probably 1878. We killed some\\r\\nthirty odd deer, and Mr. Moshier having some friends living down\\r\\nclose to the Indiana line, he shipped our venison down to his friend\\r\\nand he sold it for us. I do not know where he sold it but the checks\\r\\ncame from a man by the name of Suttell, N. Y. We caught 11 bear\\r\\nduring the fall and spring. We caught a good number of mink, coon and\\r\\nfox, also a few marten.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have said that on my trip on Thunder Bay River we caught\\r\\nseveral beaver, but on the Manistee we saw no fresh beaver signs but\\r\\nplenty of old beaver dams. We would make an occasional trip on to the\\r\\nBoardman and Rapid Rivers for mink. On Rapid River two or three miles\\r\\nabove Rickers Mill was a colony or family of three or four beaver,\\r\\nbut we did not try to catch them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy third trip to Michigan was to the Upper Peninsula, in Schoolcraft\\r\\nCounty. A pard of mine by the name of Ross and myself had a boat made\\r\\nat Manistique, and started the first of September. We poled and rowed\\r\\nthe boat up the Manistique River for a distance of about a hundred\\r\\nmiles, according to our estimate. The boat was heavily loaded with\\r\\nour outfit, and we were nearly a month making the trip up the river\\r\\nto where we built our camp on a small lake about one-half mile from\\r\\nthe main river. We found mink, marten, beaver and coon quite\\r\\nplentiful, but from what I read bear and wolves are more plentiful\\r\\nthere now than they were about 1879. At that time there was not a\\r\\nrailroad in that section, nor scarcely a tree cut in the northern\\r\\npart of the Upper Peninsula, with the exception of up about the Iron\\r\\nWorks where they were cutting timber and burning coke and charcoal.\\r\\nIn fact, I found bear more plentiful in Lower Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the fifteenth of October we had the camp in shape and a big\\r\\npile of wood cut and piled close to the door. We now began to explore\\r\\nthe country for the best sites to set our traps, mostly Nos. 2, 3 and\\r\\n4, besides seven bear traps, all Newhouse. We would build deadfalls\\r\\nalong the line, for we would not set a steel trap only where we were\\r\\nquite sure that we would make a catch. We used the water set mostly\\r\\nfor wolves and fox, and of course, for mink and coon.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood springs were not so common where water sets could be made as in\\r\\nPennsylvania. We could find occasionally a good log crossing where we\\r\\ncould get in a set for wolf, but suitable places of this kind were\\r\\nnot plentiful. We worked for beaver all we could. We would break a\\r\\nnotch in their dams and then set a trap just on the edge of break in\\r\\nwater just deep enough so the beaver would spring the trap. It was\\r\\nwhile trapping here that I learned to make the bait set for beaver.\\r\\nThis is to use the kind of wood beaver were feeding on for bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe caught three or four wolves on the ice close to the bank.\\r\\nSometimes the ice would settle along the banks and the water would\\r\\nrun over the ice too close to the shore and then freeze. This made a\\r\\ngood path, or rather place for the wolf to travel. Now, where a\\r\\nspruce or cedar tree would fall into the lake so as to leave a narrow\\r\\nspace between the boughs on the tree and the bank, was a good place\\r\\nto set. We would watch the weather and when it began snowing we would\\r\\ngo to one of these trees from the ice or water side, cut a notch in\\r\\nthe ice, put in some ashes or dry pulverized rotten wood. The notch\\r\\ncut in the ice must be just deep enough to let the trap down level\\r\\nwith the surface. The clog was concealed under a bough of the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I wish to say that I was never able to catch a timber wolf\\r\\nunless I was able to outwit him, and in order to do this the\\r\\nconditions and surroundings must be perfect for making the set. Where\\r\\nwe found good places to make a set of this kind we would place the\\r\\ncarcass of a deer several yards from shore out on the ice. This would\\r\\nentice the wolves to come around, and of course increase our chances\\r\\nof making a catch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were bothered some by having a wolverine follow a line of\\r\\ndeadfalls, tear down the bait pen and take the bait, but we did not\\r\\nallow him to do his cussedness long before we would put a trap in the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would sometimes have the parts of a deer taken down by a lynx\\r\\nwhere we had hung up venison so that it would be convenient to use\\r\\nfor bear bait. We never objected much about it for we were willing to\\r\\ntrade venison for a cat almost any time, for deer were very\\r\\nplentiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, when we were taking up our traps and getting ready to start\\r\\ndown the river as soon as the water dropped so that we dare start, we\\r\\nwere going onto a stream one day to take up three or four traps that\\r\\nwe had set for beaver, our route led us across the point of the\\r\\nridge. The point faced to the southeast, and the snow was off in\\r\\nspots on this point. When we went over this point in the morning we\\r\\nsaw many deer run from these bare spots, so when we came back along\\r\\nin the afternoon we were as careful as possible and kept the highest\\r\\nground so as to get a good view on this bare point to see how many\\r\\ndeer we could count. There were upwards of forty in sight at one\\r\\ntime. How I wish I could have had that picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not dare to start down the river until the first of June, on\\r\\naccount of the high water. We had been told that there was a camp on\\r\\nthe head of the river where they were cutting wood to be burned into\\r\\ncharcoal. While we were waiting for the water to drop we took a\\r\\nknapsack of grub and some fishing tackle and started to find the wood\\r\\nchoppers\\' camp, which we did on the second day after leaving camp. We\\r\\nstayed ten or twelve days at this camp, and while there a Frenchman\\r\\ninvited me out to a lake two or three miles from their camp and fish\\r\\nfor bass. He said he would take along a couple of traps and we would\\r\\nhave some rats for breakfast, as we were going to camp at the lake\\r\\nover night. I did not say much about rats for breakfast, as I thought\\r\\nthe man was joking. But sure enough, we had rats for breakfast, also\\r\\nplenty of fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after the man had argued and plead the case of the rats from\\r\\nall points of view, and I had done a good deal of snuffing and\\r\\nsmelling, I tasted, yes, I ate a piece of muskrat and I must confess\\r\\nit was of a fine flavor and would be splendid eating if it was not a\\r\\nrat. However, I have not tried any more from that day to this. I\\r\\nprefer partridge, and I have never been in a place where there were\\r\\nas many partridges as there were in Upper Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable how long and well one can live on one hundred pounds\\r\\nof flour, twenty-five pounds lard, ten pounds salt and some bacon,\\r\\n(tea and coffee if one thinks he can\\'t get along without it), in a\\r\\ngood game and fish country with a good gun and fishing tackle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started on our return trip down the river on the second day of\\r\\nJune. There had not been a man to our camp during this time. We were\\r\\nwell satisfied with our catch with one exception, that being bear, as\\r\\nwe only got four and they were all rather small. We had a splendid\\r\\njourney on our return trip down the river. We would see deer at\\r\\nalmost every turn and once we saw a bear swimming the river. We\\r\\ncaught lots of fish, all we could use, with hardly an effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunting and Trapping in Cameron County, Pa., in 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my last letter on hunting and trapping in Cameron County, I\\r\\npromised to give Bill Earl\\'s and my own experience in hunting in that\\r\\ncounty the next season. Well the story is not long, as we had our\\r\\ncamp already built, we concluded not to go out into the woods until\\r\\nit was time to begin hunting and to put out bear traps. Accordingly\\r\\non the last day of October we took a man with a team to take our\\r\\ntraps, camp outfit and the grub stake to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing by the way of Emporium in that county, we were compelled to\\r\\nstay there over night, the distance being too far to reach camp the\\r\\nfirst day. At Emporium we purchased what more necessaries we needed,\\r\\nthat we had not brought from home. We reached camp the second day\\r\\nabout 10 o\\'clock. When we came in sight of the camp, Bill was walking\\r\\nahead of the team with an axe cutting out brush here and there as\\r\\nneeded. All of a sudden Bill stopped, set down the axe and looked in\\r\\nthe direction of the shanty. When I was close enough so Bill could\\r\\nspeak to me, he said, \"I be-dog-on if the wicky is not occupied.\" I\\r\\nasked, \"What with, porcupines?\" Bill\\'s reply was that he had known\\r\\nporkies to do some dog-on mean work, but he had never known them to\\r\\nbuild fires.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could now see the shack, and sure enough there was a little smoke\\r\\ncurling up from the chimney. Bill said that he hoped that there was\\r\\nno one there that wanted to tarry long, for he was dog-on sorry if\\r\\nthat wicky was large enough for two families.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found the shanty occupied alright. There was a sack of crackers\\r\\nset on the table and a pot of tea set in the chimney and a couple of\\r\\nblankets lay on the bunk. After Bill had sized up the contents of the\\r\\ncamp, he concluded that the occupants did not intend to stay long,\\r\\njudging from their outfit, but Bill was mistaken. Bill said that he\\r\\nwould proceed to clean house at any rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had taken in new straw for the bunk, so we threw the old boughs\\r\\nand the other litter outside and burned it and went in for a general\\r\\nhouse cleaning. Just before dark, two men came in great haste. One\\r\\nrushed into the shack and demanded to know what in h--- does this\\r\\nmean. Bill said, \"nothing, just moving in is all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the spokesman said, \"Do you fellows pretend to own this camp?\"\\r\\nBill replied that we did, as we did some dog-on hard work building it\\r\\nat least. The one man continued to go on with a great deal of telling\\r\\nwhat he would do and what he would not, until we had supper ready,\\r\\nwhen we asked the men to eat with us. The man that had done very\\r\\nlittle talking readily consented but the other man was still inclined\\r\\nto bully matters, but he finally took a stool and sat up and ate his\\r\\nsupper. After supper we learned that they were from near Wellsville,\\r\\nN. Y. We made arrangements for the men to sleep on the floor, or\\r\\nrather on the ground at the side of the bunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning after breakfast was over, the man who proposed to\\r\\nrun things to his own liking said that he did not see any other way\\r\\nbut what we would all have to get along together the best way we\\r\\ncould in the shanty. This was more than Bill could stand so he opened\\r\\non the man and said, \"See here, stranger, I am dog-on if a aint\\r\\nwilling to do almost anything to be neighborly, but I am dog-on if it\\r\\ndon\\'t take a large house for two families to live in, and this shack\\r\\nis altogether too small.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now began to look as though we were not going to be good neighbors\\r\\nvery long, when the man that had but very little to say, up to this\\r\\ntime, said, \"See here, Hank, you know that this is not our shanty. I\\r\\ntold you that some one would be here and want it,\" and he took his\\r\\nblankets, gun and sack of crackers and started off down the run.\\r\\nAfter the other man had done some more loud talking, he gathered up\\r\\nthe rest of their plunder and started on after his partner with the\\r\\nremark that he would see us again. Bill replied that he would be\\r\\ndog-on pleased to have him come when we were at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were a little afraid that they might return and do us some dirt,\\r\\nbut they did not. They went farther down the run and built a sort of\\r\\na shelter out of boughs and pieces of bark where they stayed about\\r\\ntwo weeks, when they went home, leaving the field to Bill and myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe put in two days cutting wood and calking and mudding the shanty\\r\\nwherever the chinking and mud had been worked out by squirrels and\\r\\nother small animals. As soon as we had this work done we put in our\\r\\ntime setting our bear traps. We also built two bear pens. After we\\r\\nhad the bear traps all set, we then began putting out small traps,\\r\\nsetting the most of the small steel traps for fox and building more\\r\\ndeadfalls and repairing those that we had made the year before for\\r\\nmarten on the ridges, and along the creek for mink and coon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this work was done we gave more time to bear hunting. We had a\\r\\ngood deal of freezing weather without much snow for tracking. Being\\r\\nvery noisy under foot, we were compelled to hunt for several days by\\r\\ndriving the deer, that is, one of us would stand on the runways in\\r\\nthe heads of basins or hollows and in the low places on the ridges\\r\\nwhere it was natural for deer to pass through when jumped up. In\\r\\ngoing from one ridge to another, we would get a deer in this way\\r\\nnearly every day, and one day we had the good luck to get three bears\\r\\nwhile driving, an old bear and two cubs. We were also having fairly\\r\\ngood luck with the traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first snow that fell to make good tracking was a damp one, and\\r\\nhung on the underbrush so much that it was impossible to see but a\\r\\nfew yards unless in very open timber. Here I wish to relate an\\r\\nincident that nearly caused my hair to turn white in a very short\\r\\ntime. I am not given very much to superstitions or alarmed at\\r\\nunnatural causes, but in this case I will confess that I felt like\\r\\nshowing the white feather.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working my way very cautiously along the side of a ridge and\\r\\ndown near the base of the hill in low timber, as that is the most\\r\\nnatural place to find deer in a storm of this kind. I had just\\r\\nstepped out of the thicket into the edge of a strip of open timber\\r\\nwhere I could see for several rods along the side of the hill. I had\\r\\nbarely stepped into the open when I caught sight of some object\\r\\njumping from a knoll to a log where it was partly concealed behind\\r\\nsome trees, so that I was unable to make out what it was. I was sure\\r\\nthat I had never seen anything like it before, either in the woods or\\r\\nout in civilization. I could get a glimpse of the thing as it would\\r\\npass between the trees, then it would disappear behind brush or a\\r\\nlarge tree for a moment, then I would get a glimpse of it as it would\\r\\nmove.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes it would appear white and then a fire red. I could see that\\r\\nit was coming in my direction. As I always wore steel gray, or what\\r\\nwas commonly known as sheep gray clothing, which is nearly the same\\r\\ncolor of most large timber, I stepped to a large hemlock tree, leaned\\r\\nclose against the tree, set my gun down close to my side and stood\\r\\nwaiting to see whether the thing was natural or otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I could see that I had been frightened without\\r\\nany real cause, for it was a hunter who had dressed in fantastic\\r\\narray to put a spell on or charm the deer. He had on a long snow\\r\\nwhite overshirt and had tied a fire red cloth over his hat and a\\r\\nblack sash was tied about his waist. I stood perfectly quiet against\\r\\nthe tree until the man was within a few feet of me, I could no longer\\r\\nkeep from laughing, and I burst out with laughter. The man jerked his\\r\\ngun from his shoulder as he turned in the direction in which I was\\r\\nstanding and gazed at me for a moment and then said, \"You frightened\\r\\nme.\" I replied that I guessed that he was no more frightened than I\\r\\nwas when I first caught sight of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell the man explained that he always dressed in that manner when the\\r\\nunderbrush was loaded with snow, as the deer would stand and watch\\r\\nhim with curiosity until he was within gun shot. When in New Mexico\\r\\nmany years after I had tied a red handkerchief to a bush to attract\\r\\nthe curiosity of the antelope, and it reminded me of the hunter that\\r\\nI had seen working the curiosity dodge on the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night when I got into camp, Bill had not got in but came soon\\r\\nafter, and he had hardly got the shack door open when he began\\r\\nroaring with laughter. I inquired what it was that pleased him so.\\r\\n\"Pleased me so?\" \"I guess I was pleased, and had you seen the dog-on\\r\\nnondescript that I did, you would have laughed your boots up.\" I\\r\\nasked if he had seen the man dressed in red, white and black. Bill\\r\\nasked, \"Did you see it too?\" I told him of the hunter that I had met\\r\\nand talked with. Bill said that he had not been close enough to speak\\r\\nto it, and he was dog-on if he knew whether it was safe to get too\\r\\nclose to the dog-on thing or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had good tracking snow from this time on during the remainder of\\r\\nthe hunting season. We now each hunted by himself, working as usual\\r\\nover the ground that would bring us in the locality of our traps,\\r\\nwhich we would look after and relieve any fur bearers that we chanced\\r\\nto get.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met with one mishap during the season. Well along toward December\\r\\nI went to one of the bear traps that we had not been to in a number\\r\\nof days. The trap was a blacksmith made one with high jaws. I found\\r\\nthe trap a short distance from where it had been set, tangled in an\\r\\nold tree top with a bear\\'s foot in it. The bear had been caught just\\r\\nabove the foot. As the trap jaws closed tight together the trap clog\\r\\nhad got fast solid in the brush soon after the bear had been caught.\\r\\nThe animal twisted and pulled until he had unjointed the foot, worn\\r\\nand twisted off the skin and cords of the leg and was gone. He had\\r\\nescaped some time during the night before I came to the trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reset the trap and then took the trail of the bear, which had taken\\r\\na northeasterly course. I followed the trail until nearly night, when\\r\\nI became satisfied that he was making for a large windfall on a\\r\\nstream known as the South Fork, some fifteen miles away. I gave up\\r\\nthe trail and returned to camp, which I reached about 10 o\\'clock at\\r\\nnight. Bill was still keeping supper warm for me well knowing that\\r\\nsomething was out of the ordinary and wondering what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we held a council and concluded to look after a few\\r\\ntraps near camp and put in a day of partial rest and prepare to take\\r\\nthe bear\\'s trail early the next morning. As planned the next morning,\\r\\nwe had our blankets and a grub stake strapped to our backs and were\\r\\noff for the trail some time before daylight. Striking the bear\\'s\\r\\ntrail where I had left it about 9 o\\'clock in the forenoon, we\\r\\nfollowed the trail good and hard all day through wind jams and laurel\\r\\npatches, coming to the big windfall just before dark, very tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe put up a rude shelter and camped for the night at the edge of the\\r\\nwindfall. In the morning as soon as it was light enough to travel\\r\\nwithout danger of passing over the trail we were on the move. There\\r\\nwere several hundred acres in the windfall so we concluded to go\\r\\naround and make sure that the bear was still there. Bill skirted the\\r\\njam to the left while I went to the right. Not long after daylight it\\r\\nbegan to snow. We met on the east side of the jam about 11 o\\'clock\\r\\nwithout seeing anything of the crippled bear track, though I had\\r\\ncrossed the trail of two bears that had gone into the jam two or\\r\\nthree days before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now concluded to go back to where the two bears had gone into the\\r\\njam and one of us stand near the trail while the other one would drop\\r\\nbelow the trail and work around on the opposite side and drive them\\r\\nout if he could. The wind was blowing strong from the northeast,\\r\\nwhich would make it next to impossible for the bears to wind the\\r\\nwatches. Bill said that he would watch as he could stand the cold\\r\\nweather better than I could. It was now snowing very hard, and we\\r\\nknew that the bears were aware of the approaching storm and had gone\\r\\nto the windfall to go into winter quarters. Chances were that they\\r\\nwould not come out unless driven by getting close on to them. We were\\r\\nin hopes that the three bears might be all in one nest, and that the\\r\\none that did the driving would stand a fair chance to get a shot at\\r\\nthem as they left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made my calculations from what I knew of the jam about where the\\r\\nbear would lay. Good luck was on my side this time and I hit it just\\r\\nright, coming on to them from the opposite side from where they had\\r\\ngone in, but I did not see or hear them when they went out. The first\\r\\nthing I knew of their whereabouts was when I came on to where the\\r\\nbears had been breaking laurel brush for their bunk. Will I did some\\r\\nfine looking and listening, but all to no purpose, as they had got\\r\\nthe wind of me and had gone out. Undoubtedly they would not have done\\r\\nthis had they been in their nest a few days longer and had got well\\r\\nto sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had gone in under two large trees that had been blown out by the\\r\\nroots. They had taken dry rotten wood torn from the two old trees\\r\\nthat formed the root to their winter quarters, and with laurel brush\\r\\nand other matter they had made very good quarters for the winter. I\\r\\nsoon discovered that the lame bear was not with the two other bears.\\r\\nI did not follow the trail very far when I came onto the trail of the\\r\\nlame bear going on still further into the jam, but I did not follow\\r\\nit but continued on after the two bears to learn what luck Bill had\\r\\nhad. I heard no gun shot and was afraid that the bear had not come\\r\\nwithin gun shot of Bill, although the bears were following nearly\\r\\nback on their trail that they went in on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to the edge of the wind jam, I saw that the bear had of a\\r\\nsudden made some big jumps down the side of the hill. One of them had\\r\\nturned back into the jam while the other had followed down the hill,\\r\\nand Bill\\'s track was following the trail. I did not go far when I saw\\r\\nBill tugging away at the bear trying to draw it down to the hollow\\r\\nand near where we had camped the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was still snowing very hard, and after getting the bear down to\\r\\nthe hollow and near to what was called in those days a wagon road--a\\r\\nnear trail cut out through the woods--we went to the camp where we\\r\\nhad stayed over night and rebuilt the fire and ate a lunch. We had\\r\\nnot eaten anything since morning, not wishing to spare the time. It\\r\\nwas snowing so hard, and as we knew that we would not be able to\\r\\nreach camp until well along in the night, we concluded to again use\\r\\nthe camp of the night before. We gathered a few more hemlock boughs\\r\\nand made the shelter a little more comfortable and went to roasting\\r\\nbear meat on a stick to help out the grub we had brought with us, so\\r\\nthat we could look further for the lame bear the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen morning came, it had snowed more than twelve inches, and as we\\r\\nwere satisfied that the lame bear would not leave the jam, we\\r\\nconcluded to go down the run about five miles to where a man lived by\\r\\nthe name of Reese. Arrangements were made with him to get the bear\\r\\ndown to his place where we could get it later. From Mr. Reese\\'s we\\r\\nwent to camp and waited a few days for the snow to settle a little.\\r\\nOn the way back to camp we looked at two or three bear traps and\\r\\nfound a small bear in one of the traps, and the last bear that we got\\r\\nduring the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now began to take in the bear traps as we came near one on the way\\r\\nto camp. The snow was so deep we were obliged to reset the most of\\r\\nthe small traps, although we had when setting out the traps taken\\r\\nevery precaution to set in such places as would afford them all the\\r\\nshelter possible. After tending all the traps again, we went once\\r\\nmore to see if we could route the lame bear. We spent two days\\r\\nsearching the windfall in every quarter, but were unable to find a\\r\\ntrace of the track. We were quite positive that she was still\\r\\nsomewhere in the jam, but the snow had fallen so deep that it had\\r\\ncompletely obliterated all signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years later I was one of a party that killed a bear and captured\\r\\nher two cubs. The old bear had one foot gone. I am quite sure that it\\r\\nwas the one that had escaped from our traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now put in the time hunting deer and looking after the small traps\\r\\nuntil about the first of January, when we pulled all of our traps and\\r\\nwent home. This ended my hunting with William Earl, one of the best\\r\\npards that I ever hit the trail with, or followed a trap line. Bill\\r\\nleft these parts and went back east to his native state, and after a\\r\\ntime I lost all trace of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunting and Trapping in Cameron County.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be remembered that when Mr. Earl (or Bill, as I preferred to\\r\\ncall him,) and the writer followed the bear from the Kinzua in McKene\\r\\nCounty, through Cameron County, that we saw signs of bear, deer,\\r\\nmarten and other game quite plentiful in the region of Baley Run,\\r\\nSalt Run and Hunt\\'s Run, and that we concluded to pitch our camp in\\r\\nthat quarter. As there were no huckleberries in the vicinity of our\\r\\nhomes, we decided to kill two birds with one stone, that was to pick\\r\\nsome huckleberries and build our camp for the next season\\'s hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly about the last days of July, we took a team and our\\r\\noutfit for camp building and started for Hunt\\'s Run by way of the\\r\\nSinnamahoning and Baley Run. At this time the country in that section\\r\\nwas an unbroken forest of pine, oak and hemlock with a goon\\r\\nsprinkling of chestnut. As the saying was in those days, \"God owned\\r\\nthe land in that section,\" so all we had to do was to go into the\\r\\nwoods, select our camp site and proceed to build. (Boys, let me stop\\r\\nlong enough to say it is different nowadays; you must go through a\\r\\nwhole lot of red tape and get a permit to camp and the permit only\\r\\nlasts two weeks, when you must get a renewal.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site we selected for our camp was on the left-hand branch of\\r\\nHunt\\'s Run. We rolled up the usual box log body, about 10 x 14 feet.\\r\\nWe put up a bridge roof, putting up about four pairs of rafters and\\r\\nthen using three or four small cross poles for roof boards. We then\\r\\npeeled hemlock bark, making the pieces about four feet long, which we\\r\\nused for shingles to cover the roof with. After the roof was\\r\\ncompleted, we felled a chestnut tree which we split into spaults\\r\\nabout four feet long. With these we chinked all the cracks between\\r\\nthe logs, striking the axe into the logs, close to the edge of the\\r\\nchinking and then driving a small wedge in the slot made by the axe\\r\\nto hold the chinking in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext we gathered moss from old fallen trees and stuffed all the\\r\\ncracks, using a blunt wedge to press the moss good and tight. We then\\r\\nbegun on the mason work. We found a bank of clay that was rather free\\r\\nof stones and made a mortar by using water, making the mortar about\\r\\nas stiff as mortar usually used in house plastering. The chinking and\\r\\nmossing had been done from the inside, while we now filled the space\\r\\nbetween the logs good and full of mortar, or rather mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next work was to take the team and haul stones, which we found\\r\\nalong the run and put up the fireplace. Considerable pains was taken\\r\\nand we done a pretty good job, as we hoped to use this camp for a\\r\\nnumber of seasons. After the fireplace was completed, we hung a door,\\r\\nusing hinges made of blocks of wood and boring auger holes through\\r\\none end. Shaping the other end on two of these eyes to drive in two\\r\\nholes boring into the logs close to the door jams. The other two eyes\\r\\nwere flattened off and made long enough for door cleats as well as to\\r\\nform a part of the door hinge. Now a rod was run through these eyes\\r\\nor holes in these pieces. This formed a good, solid door hinge. Then\\r\\na door latch was made from a slat of wood, which worked on a pin in a\\r\\nhole bored in one end of the slat and a hole bored through the door.\\r\\nA small hole in the slat and a string tied to latch and run through a\\r\\nhole in the door furnished the means of raising the latch. A loop for\\r\\nthe latch to work in and a catch on the door jam and the door was\\r\\ncomplete.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe next put in the window and made a bunk or bedstead from small\\r\\npoles and the hut was completed. I think we were about four days\\r\\ndoing the work including an hour or so each day spent in picking\\r\\nhuckleberries enough for our special need. Now as the camp was\\r\\ncompleted, we began to search for a place where we could find berries\\r\\nmore plentiful than we had found them near camp. On the hillsides\\r\\nfacing the river, where there were barrens, we found more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile searching for huckleberries we found a deerlick or salt log,\\r\\nwhich the deer were working good. Bill said he guessed we had better\\r\\nappropriate the loan of the lick for one night to our own use, and\\r\\nsee if we could not get some venison to take home with us as well as\\r\\nhuckleberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun was about an hour high, we took our guns and went to the\\r\\nsalt log. There was no blind made to get in to watch them. We\\r\\nselected two jack pines that stood near together and we each climbed\\r\\ninto a tree, breaking some of the boughs out that obstructed our view\\r\\nin the direction of the lick and laid the boughs across some limbs to\\r\\nsit on. We had scarcely got our seats fixed when I heard the crack of\\r\\na limb off to our left. I whispered to Bill and pointed in the\\r\\ndirection I had heard the breaking of the limb. Bill shook his head,\\r\\nto indicate that he had not heard anything, but had hardly done so\\r\\nwhen I saw Bill begin to cautiously shift his gun from the way it was\\r\\npointed and slowly move it so as to shoot to his left. When he had\\r\\nthe gun worked around so it pointed in the direction in which he\\r\\nwanted it, he began to raise it slowly to his shoulder. I thought to\\r\\nmyself, that means venison for breakfast. I thought right, for when\\r\\nBill touched the trigger and his gun spoke, I saw two yearling deer\\r\\njump into sight and my gun came to my shoulder from habit, but there\\r\\nwas no need to shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second jump that the deer made one of them fell dead, the other\\r\\none ran a few rods, stopped and looked back to see what had become of\\r\\nhis mate. Bill\\'s gun came to his shoulder like a flash, but I\\r\\nhollowed, \"Don\\'t shoot.\" Bill dropped his gun and said, I came\\r\\ndog-on-nigh making a fool of myself. We got down from our perches and\\r\\ndragged the deer (a yearling buck) out away from the lick, removed\\r\\nthe entrails and Bill made a knapsack of the carcass and started for\\r\\ncamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun could still be seen shining on the highest peaks of the\\r\\nhills. Bill said, \"That fun was over with too quick; I had one of the\\r\\nmost comfortable seats I ever had. I had no time to enjoy it, when\\r\\nyou called my attention to those little bucks and spoiled all my\\r\\ncomfort.\" We got to camp before dark and stripped the skin from the\\r\\ndeer, spread it out, cut all the meat from the bones, layed it on the\\r\\nskin, sprinkled some salt over it, then wrapped the meat up in the\\r\\nskin, saving out a few choice pieces to frizzle over the coals and\\r\\neat with our lunch before bunking in for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had seen some parties, while picking berries during the day. They\\r\\ntold us that there was a man by the name of Sage living down on the\\r\\nriver near Emporium, who had a large clearing on the hill only about\\r\\na mile from where we were, or about two miles from our camp. He told\\r\\nus in which direction we would find the field, and said that we would\\r\\nfind Mr. Sage there, as he was up there cutting oats. As the grub\\r\\nstake for the horses was getting rather low, and as we were not yet\\r\\nready to go home, Bill said that if I would stay and jerk the venison\\r\\n(for here we cannot keep venison by hanging it up in a tree, or on a\\r\\npole, as you can on the Pacific Coast or in the Rockies), he would go\\r\\nand see Mr. Sage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning I began preparation to jerk the venison, while Bill\\r\\nwent in search of grub for the horses. There was no road, but there\\r\\nwas but very little down timber in the woods in those days, only\\r\\noccasionally a wind jam, which you had to work your way around. Bill\\r\\nfound the clearing all right, and got oats in the bundle for the\\r\\nhorses. Bill also made arrangements with Mr. Sage to bury eight\\r\\nbushels of potatoes and leave them on the hill where we could get\\r\\nthem as we wished. Bill also killed a large rattlesnake on his way to\\r\\nthe field, which he brought to camp, where we skinned and took out\\r\\nthe oil. When we were skinning the snake Bill remarked, \"that he\\r\\nthought the fur rather light on the varmint, but it was a pretty\\r\\ncuss.\" Let me say that at our place on the head waters of the\\r\\nAllegheny we had no eels, rattlesnakes or wartelberries, so we\\r\\nconcluded that we would stop one night on the Sinnamahoning and get\\r\\nsome eels to take home with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Bill was gone for horse feed I was busy jerking the venison. I\\r\\ngathered a good hill of dry hemlock bark from the logs, burned it to\\r\\na good pile of live coals. I now made a rack or gridiron by driving\\r\\nfour crotched stakes in the ground about the embers and then laid\\r\\nsmall poles across in the crotches to form a rack to spread the\\r\\nvenison on over the coals. I stood hemlock bark up about the rack,\\r\\nfreshly peeled from the tree and covering the top over also with\\r\\nbark, which forms an oven. It is necessary to remove the top or cover\\r\\noccasionally and turn the meat, and say, boys, next June when you are\\r\\nout camping just kill a small deer and prepare the meat as described.\\r\\nIs it good? I guess yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving our work completed at the camp, the next morning after we had\\r\\ngot the horses fed and the venison prepared, we drove back onto\\r\\nBaleys Run. Here we camped near the mouth of the run, and that night\\r\\nwe set fifty eel hooks, some in the run and some in the main\\r\\nSinnamahoning. I think that we caught twenty-two eels and some trout.\\r\\nAs we were now in a section where there were some barrens, which\\r\\ncontained good huckleberry picking, we put in the next day picking\\r\\nberries until near night, and drove home at night, a distance of\\r\\nabout twenty miles. All the time while picking berries, setting eel\\r\\nhooks and trout fishing, of which we did enough to supply our needs,\\r\\nwe kept a close watch for signs of animals that we intended to take\\r\\nin later on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw signs of mink, coon and where an otter had been at play on a\\r\\nsteep bank of the run. We saw signs of bear in several places where\\r\\nthey had torn old logs to pieces in search of grub and ants. We saw\\r\\nat one place where a bear had dug out a woodchuck, and I should judge\\r\\nby the amount of digging he had done that he earned his chuck. We saw\\r\\nconsiderable signs of bear in the huckleberries, and of them will\\r\\nhave more to say later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout October first, Bill and your humble servant again started for\\r\\ncamp, which we found all right. From all appearances it had been\\r\\noccupied for several days by someone, probably berry pickers, and as\\r\\nusual they had burned up what wood we had cut. Bill made a little\\r\\nkick, and said they were welcome to the camp, but he would be\\r\\n\"dog-on\" pleased if they would cut what wood they burned. Our first week\\r\\nin camp was spent in cutting a good supply of wood and mudding the\\r\\nshack a little in places where we failed to do good work the first\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing located well up at the head of the streams, it made it\\r\\nnecessary for us to do a good deal of traveling to get from one\\r\\nstream to another where the water was of sufficient size to afford\\r\\ngood trapping ground. Steel traps being none too plenty with us now,\\r\\nwe started in to build deadfalls. The territory so far as trapping\\r\\nwas concerned was left to Bill and I, and we took in the waters of\\r\\nBaley Run, the Portage, Conley Run and Hunt\\'s Run, as well as several\\r\\nlesser streams. As the Baley was the farthest from our camp, Bill\\r\\nsaid we would put up the traps on that stream first. Bill said that\\r\\nwe would go at it man fashion, for we would be compelled to get our\\r\\ngrub from the trap line, for there was no chance to take a wood job\\r\\nin that section of the country. I suggested that we might get a job\\r\\nat the lumber camp, where we sold the deer the year before, and get a\\r\\nfew beans and a little pork. I guess that Bill did not like the idea,\\r\\nfor I remember he only gave me a grunt for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay, boys, the question of pork and beans leads me to ask how many of\\r\\nyou who have a fireplace in your camp have a bean hole? Now, Bill and\\r\\nI had one in our camp, and I tell you we thought it fine and we did\\r\\nit in this way. We dug a hole in one corner of the fireplace about\\r\\ntwo and a half feet deep and about eighteen inches in diameter, using\\r\\nthe regular old style of bake kettle. This is merely an iron pot,\\r\\nwith a close fitting flange lid so as to seclude all dust and ashes,\\r\\nand we used it in this way. We would first rake a good lot of live\\r\\ncoals from the fireplace into the bean hole, having the beans already\\r\\nin the kettle. Then we would put the kettle down in the hole and rake\\r\\nthe hole full of live embers, being careful to cover the hole over\\r\\nwith plenty of ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe prepared the beans about in this fashion: After washing we soaked\\r\\nthem for about twelve hours. The water was drained off and the beans\\r\\nwere then put into the kettle with the necessary trimmings, which\\r\\nconsisted of a good chunk of pork put in the center of the beans, and\\r\\ntwo or three smaller pieces laid on top, a pinch of salt providing\\r\\nthat the pork was not sufficiently salty. A spoonful of brown sugar\\r\\nor rather a little baking molasses and a little pepper. Now this\\r\\nkettle was allowed to remain three or four days in the hole without\\r\\ndisturbing farther than to cover over occasionally with hot embers.\\r\\nYou ask if beans are good baked this way--we guess yes. We have heard\\r\\na great deal about the famous Boston baked beans, but we wish to say\\r\\nthat they are not in it compared to beans baked in a bean hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, to get back to the trap line. We took the Baley waters first.\\r\\nThis was about six miles from camp, and as it was still a little\\r\\nearlier in the season than we cared to begin to take fur, we would\\r\\nbuild the deadfalls and have them ready to set when we thought that\\r\\nfur was ripe enough to begin to gather. Bill used a good heavy axe,\\r\\nand would cut the dead pole and bed pieces and the stakes and fit\\r\\nthem all ready to put up. He would then go on and select a place to\\r\\nbuild another trap and get the material all ready as before and then\\r\\nmove on to the next place. I would follow him up and build the trap,\\r\\nmake the bait pen and have the trap all ready to set when the right\\r\\ntime came. The triggers we would make evenings in camp. We always\\r\\nused the three-stick trigger, for then we could adjust the trigger so\\r\\nthat we were sure that the front legs of the animal were over the bed\\r\\npiece, when the trap was sprung. In that condition there was not\\r\\nget-away for the animal that tried to snip the bait. We would build traps\\r\\non one stream until we had a plenty for that stream. We would take up\\r\\nanother and put in a supply on that stream, and so on until we had\\r\\ngone over as much ground as we could work to good advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the time we were putting up these deadfalls we were keeping a\\r\\nwatch out for likely places to set our steel traps for fox and other\\r\\nanimals. After we had gone over the streams we built the necessary\\r\\ndeadfalls in the dark, heavy timbered sections where we thought\\r\\nlikely that there might be marten. As it was now well along toward\\r\\nthe last of October, we set our bear traps on the different ridges in\\r\\nthe sections where the chestnut timber was the most plenty. The\\r\\nchestnut crop was good and we knew that the first hard freeze would\\r\\nopen the burs. Bill said we got to get a move on us from early in the\\r\\nmorning until after dark when we would get into camp. We wished to\\r\\nget all the traps out now that we could. Later we were going to put\\r\\nin some time gathering chestnuts, as soon as they began to fall, as\\r\\nthere was good money in gathering them. At this business there was\\r\\nlively competition with the squirrels, coons, bears and other animals\\r\\nto see which could gather the most, so naturally there is but a few\\r\\ndays good picking after the chestnuts fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill said that we would be in a deal while the nuts lasted and we\\r\\ndid, for we gathered several bushels. I do not just remember how many\\r\\nnow, but that wasn\\'t all we got while we were gathering chestnuts.\\r\\nOne day we came to where a bear had been raking for nuts and as it\\r\\nwas only about a mile from camp I said to Bill that it might be\\r\\npossible that if we would stay out and watch for Bruin as long as we\\r\\ncould see to shoot, we might get a shot at the bear. Bill said that\\r\\nhe preferred to let the traps do the watching. There was a little\\r\\nmist of rain falling, and just the right kind of weather for Bruin to\\r\\nbe prowling around. Some way it seemed to me if we stayed and watched\\r\\nwe would get a shot at a bear, but Bill had no faith and said that I\\r\\nwould get good and wet for my trouble. I told him that if he would\\r\\ntake what nuts I had gathered along to the shanty, I would stay and\\r\\nwatch awhile at least. Bill agreed, and said that he would have a hot\\r\\nsupper ready for me when I came to camp. I suggested to Bill that he\\r\\nhave the frying pan hot when I got there, for I would bring in some\\r\\nbear meat for supper. Bill said that I need not bother to skin his,\\r\\nas he would eat his hair and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Bill was gone I selected a point where I could see down\\r\\nthe hill, as well as over a good stretch of the top of the ridge. I\\r\\nhad only fairly picked my ground to watch when I heard the brush\\r\\ncrack close to me from behind. My gun came to my shoulder as I turned\\r\\nin the direction of the noise, and there stood Bill a-grinning. I\\r\\nasked him what had changed his mind. He said that if I could stand it\\r\\nhe could, so he stepped along the ridge a few yards and I leaned up\\r\\nagainst a large hemlock tree. He had scarcely taken his stand when\\r\\nall of a sudden I saw him begin to slowly raise his gun to his\\r\\nshoulder. I knew that he was about to shoot at something, but thought\\r\\nit must be a deer. I thought that I ought to shout and scare it away,\\r\\nfor I thought that Bill had come back on purpose to beat me out of\\r\\nthe sport, and I guessed right. Bill said after he had started to\\r\\ncamp it seemed to him that he had done wrong in leaving me to watch\\r\\nalone, and that I would kill a bear. So he turned back and got there\\r\\njust in time so as not to frighten the bear away, as well as to shoot\\r\\nit, which was a yearling and weighed about 125 pounds, with a fine\\r\\npelt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill apologized for the little trick. Said he would never do anything\\r\\nof the kind again. He never did. A good reason being that another\\r\\nopportunity never occurred. But later I will tell how I got the laugh\\r\\non Bill. The next morning Bill took the saddles of the bear to\\r\\nEmporium and sold the meat, but he said that bear meat was not at a\\r\\npremium in Emporium. I think he got about $6.00 out of the saddles.\\r\\nWhile Bill was gone to Emporium I took two bear traps and went on to\\r\\na ridge where I thought would be the most likely place to catch a\\r\\nbear, as there was considerable beach timber on that ridge in places.\\r\\nBeach nuts last long after chestnuts are gone, and bear would be\\r\\nlikely to work in this timber. As we had not got all of our small\\r\\ntraps out yet, Bill said that if I would finish setting the rest of\\r\\nthe small traps, he would put in the most of his time hunting deer,\\r\\nas the leaves were now pretty well off from the undergrowth, so that\\r\\nthe woods were now quite open. This I agreed to, as I knew Bill to be\\r\\na good deer hunter, while I was a little skeptical as to some of his\\r\\ntrapping methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, as the busy season was with us now, it was an early breakfast\\r\\nand a late supper day after day. Yet we were able to keep up the pace\\r\\nfrom the natural stimulating desire for sport, being anxious to know\\r\\nwhat the results of the next day would be. We were having the usual\\r\\nsuccess of the average hunter and trapper who, as Bill said, if\\r\\nwilling to get a move on, our supply of meat and game was never\\r\\nlacking, for I always shot at small game when hunting deer. Bill said\\r\\nthat he did not like to come into camp empty handed, so he would\\r\\nshoot a grouse or a squirrel whenever a chance occurred. We had no\\r\\nsnow up to this time, so that deer hunting was a little dull, and\\r\\nBill said that he would take a line of traps, either on Baley Run or\\r\\non the Conley, as I liked. I said, take your choice, Bill, so he said\\r\\nhe would go to Conley Run, which was a little farther from camp than\\r\\nthe Baley Run, and one or two more bear traps than on Baley Run.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found a coon or two, and I think I got a fox and one marten, but no\\r\\nmink or other furs. I found that a bear had been to one trap and torn\\r\\ndown the bait pen and taken the bait, but left the trap unsprung. I\\r\\nknew that he would cut the same trick again, if I set the trap there,\\r\\nso I bent over a small sapling and hung the carcass of a coon on it\\r\\nfor a bait. The carcass hung four or five feet from the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: RESULTS OF A FEW WEEKS\\' TRAPPING.]\\r\\n\\r\\nI set the trap under the carcass and said to myself, \"Old fellow,\\r\\nwhen you take that coon, there will be a bear dance.\" I got to camp\\r\\nlong after dark, but when I came in sight of camp and looked for a\\r\\nlight, there was no light to be seen, or any Bill to be found in\\r\\ncamp. I lit a light and looked at my watch. It was only a few minutes\\r\\nof eight o\\'clock. I got supper and waited until nine o\\'clock, but no\\r\\nBill came, so I laid down on the bunk to rest, expecting Bill to turn\\r\\nup every minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dropped to sleep and when I awoke, the fire had burned out and Bill\\r\\nhad not returned. I looked at my watch. It was after three o\\'clock,\\r\\nand I knew that there would be no more sleep for me. I went outside\\r\\nand listened, but no sound could be heard. I got my breakfast, put an\\r\\nextra lunch in my knapsack, and sat down and waited for the break of\\r\\nday. As soon as the first streaks of light appeared in the east, I\\r\\nstrapped on my knapsack, took my gun and started in the direction in\\r\\nwhich I had known Bill to take. I followed the ridge to the Conley\\r\\nRun waters, over which Bill would likely come if he had been detained\\r\\nin that region.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to the head of a run that led to the main Conley waters,\\r\\nI stopped at the brow of the hill. I could look down into the hollow.\\r\\nHere I knew that I could be heard for some distance. I listened for\\r\\nsome time to see if I could hear a gun shot or any other noise that\\r\\nwould lead me to the whereabouts of Bill. Not a sound to be heard,\\r\\nnot even the hoot of an owl. I gave a long whoop and then listened,\\r\\nbut still no answering sound. I again gave a long continued \"co-hoop\"\\r\\nand Bill burst out laughing, and asked what was the matter with me.\\r\\nBill had sat down on a fallen tree that lay close to a large pine\\r\\ntree to rest before making the last pull to the top of the ridge. He\\r\\nhad caught a glimpse of me just before I came to the brow of the hill\\r\\nwhere I stopped to send a wireless message. Bill skulked behind a\\r\\npine tree to see what I would do and give me a scare, when I came\\r\\nalong.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I inquired what had kept him out all night, he said that he got\\r\\nso big a job on his hands that he could not get to camp. Bill said\\r\\nthat he had got about half way down the side of the hill from the\\r\\nridge leading down into the Conley River, when he jumped a buck,\\r\\nwhich Bill said slid down the hill like a greased rag. He fired at\\r\\nthe pile and happened to catch him well back to the hips. The deer\\r\\nbeing wounded through the small intestines made it very sick, but it\\r\\nwas still able to lead Bill a merry chase. Bill had been working from\\r\\nthe middle of the forenoon until about three o\\'clock in the afternoon\\r\\nbefore he was able to get in a finishing shot on the buck. While\\r\\nfollowing the deer, he had come near one of the places where we had a\\r\\nbear trap set and found that a bear had been caught. He followed the\\r\\ntrail a little ways, and as it led in an opposite direction from that\\r\\ntaken by the deer, Bill said he thought he would finish one job at a\\r\\ntime, so he continued after the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Bill was able to get in the finishing shot on the deer, it had\\r\\nswung around in the direction of the trail of the bear, so that when\\r\\nBill finally got the buck, he knew that he could not be far from the\\r\\ntrail of the bear. He hung up the saddles of the deer, which he had\\r\\nstarted to take to camp, and let the bear rest until the next\\r\\nmorning. After hanging up the saddles he didn\\'t search long until he\\r\\nfound the trail of the bear, and followed the trail only a little\\r\\nways, when he found Bruin fast in a clump of brush. Bill then killed\\r\\nthe bear, and taking out the entrails, rolled the carcass up over a\\r\\nlog and again started for camp with the deer saddles. He did not go\\r\\nfar when it was so dark that it was difficult to travel and carry the\\r\\ndeer saddles and gun, so Bill said he thought he would build a little\\r\\nshelter and camp for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill had started for camp with the saddles of the buck as soon as he\\r\\ncould see to travel. He was near the top of the ridge on his way to\\r\\ncamp and had sat down to rest when I came to the brow of the hill and\\r\\nbegan to \"co-hoop\" to see if I could get any word from him, which I\\r\\ndid and much closer than expected. Bill brought his load up to where\\r\\nI was, and threw it down with the remark \"I suppose that you did not\\r\\nthink to bring along an extra lunch, did you?\" When I told him I had\\r\\nthe extra lunch, and also a bottle of tea (Bill being a great hand\\r\\nfor tea). Well, said Bill, \"then we are all right, once more.\" We now\\r\\nhung the deer saddles up, and went back after the bear. After setting\\r\\nthe bear trap again, as Bill did not have time after he had killed\\r\\nthe bear, we started to carry the bear to camp whole. We soon found\\r\\nit too heavy to carry that way, so skinned it and hung up the\\r\\nforeparts and took the skin and hindquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, we went back after the deer. We went to where Bill\\r\\nhad left the fore parts of the deer; then we went to where the fore\\r\\nparts of the bear were left, intending to take them as far as where\\r\\nthe deer saddles were and leave them there, and take the deer saddles\\r\\nto camp. When we got to where the bear meat had been left, we found\\r\\nthat a cat had been there, and filled his shirt on bear meat. It was\\r\\nnot far to where we had a steel trap setting. I told Bill to go on\\r\\nslowly with the deer meat, and I would go and get the trap and set it\\r\\nfor the cat. Bill said that he thought that would be the right thing\\r\\nto do, as there was a two dollar bounty on wild cats. He said we\\r\\ncould carry the pelt of the cat a great deal easier than we could\\r\\ntote the bear meat; he thought that the cat skin and the bounty would\\r\\neven things up for the bear meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon had the trap set for the cat, and then hurried on to catch\\r\\nBill. We went to camp with the deer and the next morning we took the\\r\\nbear and deer saddles to Emporium and shipped them to New York. The\\r\\ndistance that we toted those saddles must have been ten or twelve\\r\\nmiles. Say boys, won\\'t a man do more hard work to get thirty cents\\r\\nout of a coon skin, or a saddle of venison, or bear, than he would to\\r\\nget thirty dollars in some other way? As it had been three or four\\r\\ndays since we had been over a good part of the trap line, we now got\\r\\nback to regular business, each one taking up his line of traps. Each\\r\\nnight when he came to camp, we would have some kind of pelts to\\r\\nstretch, either two or three coon, a mink or two, as many more fox,\\r\\nwith now and then a marten. It would take the evening to stretch the\\r\\npelts and tell our day\\'s experience just what particular trap we got\\r\\nthat or this fox in, or that mink or coon; just how clever some shy\\r\\nold fox has worked to get the bait at a certain trap; on what\\r\\nparticular ridge or point we had seen Old Golden\\'s track (you know\\r\\nall large buck deer have the name of \"Old Golden\".)\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man of the woods or trap line knows what pleasure there is in\\r\\nrelating the experience of the day\\'s hunt or of the trap line to his\\r\\npard during the evening in camp. Yet, I will tell of one occurrence\\r\\nthough I have told the story many times, and I cannot say that I\\r\\nrelate it with any great amount of pleasure. Still since many years\\r\\nhave passed, I have often laughed over the circumstance. I can still\\r\\nsee that sympathetic grin of Bill\\'s, when he would ask \"if it hurt me\\r\\nmuch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a lowery morning, and Bill proposed that we go together and\\r\\nlook after a line of traps on Salt Run, and then put in the balance\\r\\nof the day still-hunting deer. We went down to the lower end of the\\r\\nline, worked up the run so as to be near the top of the ridge and in\\r\\na locality where we expected deer to be. We had not looked at more\\r\\nthan three or four traps, when we came to one that was set under the\\r\\nbank. The trap chain was stapled to a root, and was stationary (and\\r\\nlet me say here that I believe it bad policy to fasten a trap to\\r\\nanything, stationary) and it certainly was in this case for me. The\\r\\nwater was quite deep right at the point where the trap was set and\\r\\ncame close up to the bank. In order to see the trap, it was necessary\\r\\nto lie down on my stomach, and lean my head over the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I looked down under the bank, I saw that there was some animal\\r\\nin the trap. The trap chain was drawn tight and when I drew gently on\\r\\nthe chain I could tell that some kind of an animal was in the trap. I\\r\\nlittle suspected that it was loaded, as it proved to be. I could not\\r\\nsee what sort of an animal it was, but supposed it was a mink. It did\\r\\nnot like to be drawn out in sight, and I was afraid to pull too hard\\r\\non the chain for fear I would draw his foot out of the trap. I let up\\r\\nand straightened up to consult Bill, as to the best thing to do. Bill\\r\\nsaid, pull him out and if he gets away, we will get him at another\\r\\ntrap, and I now suspect that Bill knew what was coming. I leaned down\\r\\nover the bank and stuck my head down to see where the chain was. All\\r\\nof a sudden I was struck with something more terrible than lightning\\r\\nif not quite so fatal, and for the next half hour I was rolling on\\r\\nthe ground and washing my eyes. Bill said that I danced the Bear\\r\\ndance and a Pot Full of Catfish all at the same time. When I\\r\\nrecovered enough to see what \"hit me\", I found that I had been\\r\\nterribly shot by a measly skunk square in both eyes. Bill was\\r\\ngrinning and asking \"if it hurt much\" and telling me that I could see\\r\\nbetter after a little and lots of other sympathetic nothings. I hope\\r\\nthat none of you may ever have the experience that I met with by the\\r\\ntreatment of that infernal skunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the atmosphere and my eyes had cleared somewhat, we went on and\\r\\nlooked after the balance of the traps on the run. We then started out\\r\\nto hunt deer, Bill taking one side of the ridge and I the other. I\\r\\nsaw nothing more of Bill until I reached camp long after dark. I\\r\\nworked along the different spires of the main ridge and through the\\r\\nheads of the different basins, and only got a glimpse of an old\\r\\nbuck\\'s tail, making over the ridge and beckoning me to come on. He\\r\\nhad come over from the opposite side of the ridge and had got wind of\\r\\nme before he was fairly in sight. I kept on working the different\\r\\npoints and basins, shaping my course as best I could in the direction\\r\\nof the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nA drizzling rain kept up all day, and deer had not moved very much. I\\r\\nfelt confident that towards evening the deer would come out in the\\r\\nopen to feed in spite of the rain, and pretty well toward night I had\\r\\nthe satisfaction of seeing three deer feeding along the hillside and\\r\\ncoming in my direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind was in my favor, and as the deer were rather too far to\\r\\nshoot, I stood quiet, only occasionally moving from one tree to\\r\\nanother as a favorable opportunity occurred. The deer finally worked\\r\\nup in gun shot, and they proved to be an old doe, a yearling and the\\r\\ndoe\\'s fawn. The yearling was undoubtedly the doe\\'s fawn of the year\\r\\nbefore. I was very careful to make a sure shot on the doe. The\\r\\nyearling and the fawn only took a few jumps when the gun cracked and\\r\\nthe doe went down, and stood looking at the old lady to see what had\\r\\nhappened to her. I gave the yearling the contents of the other\\r\\nbarrel. He made a jump or two and went down, the fawn still standing\\r\\nand wondering what was taking place, but before I could get a load\\r\\ninto my gun, the little fellow thought it best to move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the entrails out of the two I had shot, hung them up and took\\r\\na lively pace to camp. Bill was already in and had supper waiting.\\r\\nBill asked me if I had seen any deer, and when I told him what I had\\r\\ndone, he said that he had seen a deer. I told him that if he had used\\r\\na little skunk eye-opener, he probably would have seen some deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it had now been three or four days since we had made the rounds of\\r\\nthe bear traps, we concluded that we would not spend any particular\\r\\ntime in deer hunting until we had looked all of the bear traps over.\\r\\nWe were quite sure that some of the traps would be likely to be in a\\r\\nmixup with bruin as the weather had been favorable for bruin to be\\r\\nprowling around. Further we had seen several fresh tracks in the past\\r\\nfew days. Early in the morning with an extra lunch in our knapsack we\\r\\nstarted out to see what luck with bruin, each taking a different\\r\\nroute.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill went to Baley Run, while I went to Conley Run. I had not gone\\r\\nfar out on my road, when I came across a man that had been out as he\\r\\nsaid, hunting deer. But from the story he told, I judged that he had\\r\\nput in the greater part of his time hunting himself, and he was still\\r\\nlost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man informed me that he was from Lockhaven, Pa., and that his\\r\\nname was Henry Jacobs; and that he was boarding at a farmhouse on the\\r\\nPortage but had gotten a little mixed and was unable to find his way\\r\\nout to his boarding place. I told him that I was on my way to the\\r\\nConley waters to look after some bear traps, and if he wished he\\r\\ncould go with me to the main branch of the Conley. Then he could\\r\\nfollow the stream down until it emptied into the Portage, and to the\\r\\nroad which would take him to his boarding house, which Mr. Jacobs\\r\\nseemed pleased to do. But it proved that Mr. Jacobs\\' destiny was in\\r\\nother directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first bear trap that we came to, we found a \"porky\" in it. I\\r\\ncould see that Mr. Jacobs was very much excited and began to ask many\\r\\nquestions as to bears and bear trapping. When we came to where the\\r\\nsecond trap was setting, we found things generally torn up and the\\r\\ntrap gone, and it was plain to be seen that it was no cub that had\\r\\ntaken the trap this time. The bear had gone only a few yards, when he\\r\\nhad gotten fast in some saplings, and he had gnawed the brush and\\r\\nraked the trees and \"raised Ned\" generally; but had finally released\\r\\nthe clog and had gone on down the hillside.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time I had discovered that Mr. Jacobs had become pretty\\r\\nnervous and was shaking rather too much to do good shooting. At every\\r\\nrod we advanced along the trail, it was plain to be seen that Mr.\\r\\nJacobs was becoming more and more excited. We did not follow the\\r\\ntrail far when we discovered Bruin fast again. We went up within a\\r\\nfew yards of the bear, who did not seem to like our company and would\\r\\nchank his jaws and snort similar to an angry hog.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told Mr. Jacobs to shoot the bear, and he did shoot somewhere, but\\r\\nI could not say that he shot in the direction of the bear. As my\\r\\nattention had been on the bear, I had not noticed Mr. Jacobs in\\r\\nparticular, but when I saw that he had entirely missed the bear, I\\r\\nlooked at him and he was shaking so from excitement, that he could\\r\\nnot have hit a barn, and drops of sweat stood all over his forehead.\\r\\nHe had a double barrel rifle, and as soon as he fired the first shot,\\r\\nhe advanced a few steps toward the bear and fired again, and at once\\r\\nbegan to reload his gun, all the time going nearer to the bear until\\r\\nI was afraid that he would get so close that the bear could reach\\r\\nhim. I had to caution him and tell him to step back, that he was\\r\\ngetting too close.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Jacobs had one barrel of his gun loaded, he immediately\\r\\nfired again, with the same results of the other two shots. I told him\\r\\nto take my gun and try it, which he did with no better results. Mr.\\r\\nJacobs was all the time becoming more and more excited, and the sweat\\r\\nwas running off him like a man in the harvest field. I loaded my gun,\\r\\nwhile Mr. Jacobs was loading his, and after Mr. Jacobs fired another\\r\\nshot with no better results, I though that the fun had gone far\\r\\nenough, and shot the bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the bear was dead, Mr. Jacobs wondered why it was so hard to\\r\\nhit a bear\\'s head. \"Just look at it,\" he said, \"it is as large as a\\r\\ndry goods box\". As soon as the bear was dead, Mr. Jacobs wanted to\\r\\nknow if I would sell the bear. When I told him that I expected to\\r\\nsell it, he asked what it was worth. I told him that I thought the\\r\\nhide and meat would bring thirty or thirty-five dollars. He drew out\\r\\nhis purse and said, \"I will take it.\" I told him that if he wanted\\r\\nthe bear, that we would call it twenty-five dollars, as he should\\r\\nhave something for his part in the game. He declared that the hunt\\r\\nhad been worth a hundred dollars to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made a sort of a litter or drag rack with which we managed to haul\\r\\nthe bear down the hill to an old lumber road where it could be\\r\\nreached with a team.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after this I received a copy of the Williamsport Sun\\r\\ncontaining the report of a monstrous bear captured by Mr. Jacobs in\\r\\nthe wilds of Cameron County. It was a bear story equal to the one the\\r\\nprophet relates when the children called him Baldy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got to camp I found Bill stretching a couple of mink skins. He\\r\\nhad also got a fox or two, and said that a bear had been in one of\\r\\nthe bear traps, but had escaped, leaving two toes in the trap. Bill\\r\\nwas considerably down at the heel over the escape of the bear, and\\r\\nsaid that if he had attended to the trap the day before, that the\\r\\nbear was then in the trap; that he had put up a hard fight before he\\r\\nhad made his escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bill called for my report I took out a marten skin and the money\\r\\nthat I got for the bear and layed them on the table and told Bill\\r\\nthere was my count. Bill said that I got the marten from one of the\\r\\ndeadfalls, but he was dog-on sorry if he could tell where I caught\\r\\nthe money. When I told him about Mr. Jacobs and the capture of the\\r\\nbear, Bill said he would have given a summer\\'s work to have been\\r\\nthere and seen the man sweat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said that I would relate how it happened that I got even with Bill\\r\\nfor the bear that he killed on my watching grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after we had gone the rounds of the traps, we again put in our\\r\\ntime still-hunting. Bill had gone south of camp, while I went east. I\\r\\nhad traveled until the middle of the afternoon without having any\\r\\nluck or seeing any deer. So I shifted my course to the west and\\r\\nworked my way in the direction of a \"burn-down\" that was in the head\\r\\nof a hollow. As soon as I came to the brow of the ridge and looked\\r\\ndown into the basin I saw four deer feeding and working towards me.\\r\\nThe wind was blowing directly from the deer towards me, so I stood\\r\\nquiet and in a few minutes the deer fed up within easy range. I\\r\\npulled the gun onto an old doe in the lead, and broke her down almost\\r\\nin her tracks. The three remaining deer made a few jumps in my\\r\\ndirection and stopped and looked back, which gave me a good shot at a\\r\\nyearling buck, which also went down in my sight. The other two deer\\r\\nran close by me and over the ridge into the green timber. I had\\r\\nhardly cut the deers\\' throats when Bill called out, \"This is a dog-on\\r\\npretty trick that you have played me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBill had been following these deer all day and had followed to the\\r\\n\"burn-down\" and had seen the deer on the opposite hill, but too far\\r\\naway to shoot. As the wind was against him he had dropped down the\\r\\nhollow a ways, crossed and worked up around on the opposite side to\\r\\nget the wind in his favor, and was just about ready to fire on the\\r\\ndeer when I began shooting. After Bill had explained how he had been\\r\\nworking the deer all day and then have me slip in just as he had the\\r\\ngame bagged and swipe it, Bill claimed was dog-on mean. I cautioned\\r\\nBill to hold his temper and I would call it even on the bear he\\r\\nswiped from me, and told him I was pleased to have him on hand to\\r\\nhelp hang up the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had worked along now up to about the middle of December with the\\r\\nvarious ups and downs that one on the trap line and trail always meet\\r\\nwith. We had killed twelve or fourteen deer, and I think we had\\r\\ncaught six bears and had made a fair catch of fox, mink, marten and\\r\\nsome other furs. There had not been much snow up to this time, when a\\r\\nfall of 12 or 14 inches came all in one night. Bears had not denned\\r\\nup to this time, but we were quite sure that bruin would now go into\\r\\nwinter quarters. We concluded to gather up the bear traps and all the\\r\\nsmall traps that were not setting in springs that did not freeze, or\\r\\nthose setting in other likely places to make a catch. In nearly the\\r\\nlast bear trap that we went to get, we found a bear, and when we\\r\\nbegan to skin it we found that it had lost two toes on one forefoot.\\r\\nWe concluded that it was the same bear that had escaped from Bill\\'s\\r\\ntrap some time before, although it was eight or ten miles from where\\r\\nthe trap was that had held Bruin\\'s toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two after the heavy fall of snow we got a letter from a man\\r\\nby the name of Comstock, living at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, asking\\r\\nthe privilege to come and camp with us and hunt deer until the season\\r\\nclosed, the first of January. He stated that he had never killed a\\r\\ndeer, and that he was very anxious to kill one. We wrote him to come\\r\\non, and that one of us would be at Emporium on the following Friday\\r\\nto guide him to our camp. Friday morning I went to Emporium and found\\r\\nMr. Comstock there as agreed. He had paraphernalia enough to equip a\\r\\nfair-sized army, so we hired a team to take the outfit to camp and\\r\\nalso bring out the saddles of a bear and what venison we had on hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three or four days Mr. Comstock hunted all by himself but had no\\r\\nluck in the way of killing deer, as he said it took more time to hunt\\r\\nthe shanty than he had to hunt deer, and suggested that we all hunt\\r\\nin company. We had now been on the ground long enough so that we had\\r\\nlearned all the runways. Bill said that if I would take Mr. Comstock\\r\\ndown to a certain runway, which he had given the name of Fork Point,\\r\\nand place him on it, he would drive the ridge and see if he could not\\r\\ndrive a deer to Mr. Comstock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill started a bunch of five deer and succeeded in getting a shot and\\r\\nbreaking a foreleg of a large doe. As the doe with the broken leg\\r\\nsoon dropped out from the other deer, he was sure that the deer had\\r\\nstart enough so that they would come through to where Comstock and I\\r\\nwere watching, he decided to take the trail of the broken legged doe,\\r\\nand as good luck, the deer did come through to Mr. Comstock, and as\\r\\nhe had an Osgood gun with four shots, he succeeded in killing a very\\r\\nlarge buck. After firing the four shots, the fun began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Comstock was determined to take the buck to camp, as he wanted to\\r\\ntake the deer home whole. We had a very steep point to climb for a\\r\\ndistance of five hundred yards to reach the top of the ridge. The\\r\\ndeer weighed about two hundred pounds. Any hunter will tell you what\\r\\nan awkward job it is to carry a deer of that weight lashed to a pole.\\r\\nMr. Comstock would not consent to drawing the deer for fear it would\\r\\nrake the hair off. Well, we could not carry it up the steep point on\\r\\nthe pole, as the swaying of the deer would throw us off our feet. Mr.\\r\\nComstock said that he would carry it alone if I would help him get it\\r\\non his shoulder. Mr. Comstock was a large man, weighing over two\\r\\nhundred pounds, but nevertheless I did not think he would be able to\\r\\ncarry the deer and told him so. After some hard tugging we got the\\r\\ndeer on his shoulder and he started up the hill. I started to get out\\r\\nof the way, and I was none too soon in doing so. Mr. Comstock had not\\r\\ntaken a half dozen steps when back he came, deer and all, like ten\\r\\nthousand bricks. But as he did not break any limbs or his neck, he\\r\\nwas bound to try it again, which he did with the same result. But\\r\\nthis time he was quite badly bruised, and he was now satisfied to\\r\\nleave the deer until morning, when Bill went with us and we made a\\r\\nsort of a litter and carried it to camp whole; and he was a proud and\\r\\nhappy man. When Mr. Comstock and I left the deer and decided to await\\r\\nreinforcements, we struck the trail of Bill, drawing a deer in the\\r\\ndirection of camp, so we now knew why Bill had not followed the trail\\r\\nof the deer through to where Comstock and I were watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now about the closing time for deer hunting, so after Mr.\\r\\nComstock had left for home, Bill and I put in the time until the\\r\\nfirst of March tending the small traps with the usual success of the\\r\\naverage trapper, getting a fox, or mink or marten or some piece of\\r\\nfur nearly every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the team which we had written home for came and got our camp\\r\\noutfit and our furs, we broke camp and went home to await another\\r\\ntrapping season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrapping and Bee Hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line and trail, as every trapper and hunter\\r\\nlikes to know what other trappers and hunters are doing, I will tell\\r\\nof some of my last season\\'s (1908) doings. Having been somewhat\\r\\nrelieved from my old enemy--rheumatism--I concluded to take a trip\\r\\nsouth and see if I could not find a place suitable to my liking where\\r\\nI might escape some of the rigorous cold of the Northern Pennsylvania\\r\\nwinters.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went first into Southeastern Missouri. Here I found land cheap,\\r\\nunimproved lands ranging from $3.00 to $15.00 per acre; also plenty\\r\\nof timber for fuel and building purposes; plenty of fish of various\\r\\nkinds, some deer, a few wild turkeys, no bear, some mink, plenty of\\r\\nraccoon, a few otter and fox; with minor other fur-bearers, which was\\r\\nall quite satisfactory to me, but I did not like the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Poplar Bluff, Missouri, I went to Kenset, Arkansas, where I\\r\\nfound the conditions as to the price of lands satisfactory, although\\r\\nthe country was much less broken than Southern Missouri. As to water,\\r\\nwell, there was water almost anywhere; in fact, you could hardly\\r\\ncross the streets without wading in water. The people who were\\r\\nnatives of that country informed me that the water in the streets was\\r\\nnot always so plenty, as they said that there had been very heavy\\r\\nrains of late. Here I found game of all kinds quite scarce, although\\r\\nI was told that southeast of Kenset game was quite plenty, including\\r\\nbear, deer, turkeys, quail, etc., and that mink, otter, coon,\\r\\nopossum, also a few wolves, were to be found. The water gave me the\\r\\nchills in three days, so I concluded to move to other parts of the\\r\\nlower St. Francis River, in Lee County. There appeared to be quite a\\r\\nplenty of mink, otter, coon and some bear, but the cane brakes were\\r\\npretty thick in the bottoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that if one was well prepared for trapping, they could do\\r\\nfairly well in either St. Francis or Lee County. I went from Hanes in\\r\\nLee County, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee. From Memphis I went to a\\r\\ntown by the name of Shepard, on the Hatchie River, in Haywood County,\\r\\nTennessee. Along the Hatchie River there were signs of otter, mink\\r\\nand coon quite plenty, and in some places the cane brakes were quite\\r\\nopen. I liked the lay of the land here very well. It was just rolling\\r\\nenough to suit my fancy, but again I failed to find our cold,\\r\\nPennsylvania spring water. From Shepard I went to Pickens, in Pickens\\r\\nCounty, South Carolina. Here I found fairly good water, but other\\r\\nconditions were not entirely to my liking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I did not have time to look up the game or rather the\\r\\nfur-bearers as thoroughly as I would have liked to, yet I saw\\r\\nconsiderable signs of mink and coon and was told that there were\\r\\nquite a number of otter in that section on some of the streams. From\\r\\nPickens I bought a ticket to Columbus, Ohio, where I intended to stop\\r\\nover a day and call on the editor of the greatest of sporting\\r\\nmagazines, _Hunter-Trader-Trapper,_ but when I got to Columbus my\\r\\ncourage failed. I was afraid that the editor would be too busy\\r\\npushing the quill to bother with a lone trapper, so concluded to\\r\\nhasten back to old Potter, where chills, jiggers, ticks, fleas and\\r\\npoisonous snakes are unknown, and where the cold, sparkling spring\\r\\nwater flows from the mountain side to your very door. Say, boys, you\\r\\nmay think that I am stuck on the water question. Well, I am, and I\\r\\nhave good cause to me. Only for spring water, I should not have been\\r\\nable to have made the journey which I am writing of.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past two years, barring the time I was south, I have drank\\r\\nfrom four to six quarts of cold spring water every twenty-four hours.\\r\\nI have got more relief from rheumatism than I ever did from all the\\r\\nrheumatism remedies that I ever knew of, and I have tried the most of\\r\\nthem. I used all the salt in my food that I could to aid the desire\\r\\nfor water, and took six drops of oil of wintergreen three times a\\r\\nday. Now, if any of the old trappers have rheumatism and the good\\r\\nspring water, I ask you to try it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, after getting back home and resting a few days and the frost\\r\\nbegan to hit the pumpkin vine, I began to feel as I imagined that the\\r\\nwild goose does about their migratory time. At least I felt as though\\r\\nI should fly if I did not get into the woods. We were having splendid\\r\\nweather for camping, and the warm, dry, sunny days afforded splendid\\r\\nweather for bee hunting, and after the trap and gun then my delight\\r\\nis to trail the honey bee to his den tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day when a young man called on me and said that he would give me\\r\\nan interest in a \"goose pasture\" to go out in the woods and camp, I\\r\\nwas interested. Smoky Jim (that is his nickname) although his name is\\r\\nCharles Earl, and there is nothing smoky about Charley except his\\r\\npipe, which he is very fond of, too much so, I think, for so young a\\r\\nman. Well, when Charley said that he would like to go and camp out in\\r\\nthe woods, I was practically as good as gone. I knew Smoky to be a\\r\\nlively kid and all right, although he had never put in any time as a\\r\\ntrapper or a bee hunter. I said, \"Smoky, can you see a bee fly?\"\\r\\nSmoky said that he thought he could, for he knew that he could tell\\r\\nwhen one stung him, but he had never watched to see how far he could\\r\\nsee one fly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found that Smoky was given to making comical remarks as well as to\\r\\nsmoking. I said, \"Smoky, what day can you go?\" He replied, \"Any day.\"\\r\\nThis was on Tuesday, so I said, \"Alright, Smoky, be here Thursday and\\r\\nwe will start early Friday morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky said, \"Alright, but we will not get a darn thing while we are\\r\\ngone if we go on Friday unless we get drowned, and there will have to\\r\\nbe more water in the creek than there is now or we won\\'t get that\\r\\nmuch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had already made application to the State Tourist Commissioner for\\r\\na permit to camp on state lands. It may be well to state here for the\\r\\nbenefit of those who wish to so camp in this state (Pennsylvania) that\\r\\nthe authorities will not give a permit to camp for a longer time than\\r\\n14 days. In my case they were very obliging and made out the papers\\r\\nfor several applicants of 14 days each, so that it would only have\\r\\nbeen necessary to have signed one of the applications and send it on\\r\\na few days before the previous application had expired.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK FISHING ON THE SINNAMAHONING.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were all ready to start Friday morning. Our route lay over the\\r\\nmountains a distance of about 20 miles from the head waters of the\\r\\nAllegheny to the head water of the west branch of the Susquehana\\r\\nwaters, known as the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning. We pitched our\\r\\ntent just at the point where the Buffalo and Susquehana Railroad\\r\\nbegins to cross the divide, known as the Hogback, by means of several\\r\\nswitch backs. It is a splendid sight to see two or three trains\\r\\nworking their way up the mountain\\'s side on a clear, frosty morning,\\r\\nwhen the steam and smoke show so plain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not get the tent in good shape for the first night, nor did we\\r\\nget our bunk up, owing to its being so late when we got to our\\r\\ncamping ground. The first night in camp we had a sharp frost and in\\r\\nthe morning Smoky Jim\\'s fever for camping had dropped fully one-half.\\r\\nHe complained that any one that would go into such a country to camp\\r\\nshould be reported for trespassing on the rights of the porcupine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took until the third day to get our camp in good shape. We built a\\r\\nskeleton frame of small poles all over the tent, leaving a space of\\r\\nabout 18 inches between tent and frame, and thatched it good with\\r\\nhemlock boughs. While we were working at the camp we had our bee bait\\r\\nout, and the second day after we put out the bait no bees came to it.\\r\\nSmoky laughed at me and said that a honey bee was too intelligent to\\r\\nstop in a place like that, but Smoky was wrong. The next morning\\r\\nafter the sun had got well above the top of the hills, so as to warm\\r\\nup things down in the valley, I heated a large stone quite hot and\\r\\nburned some honey comb on it. It was not long before Smoky called out\\r\\nto me and said that there was one fool of a bee. It was not long\\r\\nbefore we had bees a-plenty. We paid no attention to them farther\\r\\nthan to keep plenty of bait out for them. Every bee hunter knows how\\r\\nmuch steadier a bee flies after they have the bait well located.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the camp was well completed and a good pile of wood cut we gave\\r\\nour attention to the bees. We soon located two lines, one going\\r\\nnearly east while the other went nearly south. I told Smoky to take\\r\\nhis hatchet and go across the creek some 50 rods and make an opening\\r\\nor a stand about half way between the two lines, or about southeast\\r\\nfrom the stand, and when he had it ready, to call to me and I would\\r\\nbring the bees over and we could get a cross line and locate nearly\\r\\nthe tree that the bees were in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe soon got the direction in which the bees flew. I then told Smoky\\r\\nto take the line that now flew in a westerly course from the stand\\r\\nand in the direction of two or three large maple trees. The other\\r\\nline now flew nearly north from the stand and back toward the creek\\r\\nwhere there was considerable large timber still standing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the bait on the stand, I took the course of the bees that\\r\\nwere now flying north and went to a large birch tree that was\\r\\nstanding on the bank of the creek. I was still several rods from the\\r\\ntree when the bees began coming to me and I knew that the tree was\\r\\nclose by. I was looking the different trees over to see which tree\\r\\nthe bees were in when Smoky began to halloo as though something\\r\\nterrible had happened him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuessing at the cause of Smoky\\'s shouting, I continued on in the\\r\\ndirection in which the line led and soon saw the bees going into the\\r\\nlarge birch tree. I took my knife and cut the letters B T on the tree\\r\\nand then went to Smoky, who was still making the woods ring with his\\r\\nshouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky began guying me, saying that I was an old bee hunter but it\\r\\ntook Smoky to find the first bee tree. I did not tell him that I had\\r\\nfound the tree that the other line of bees went to, but agreed with\\r\\nhim. I told him to mark the tree that he had located and then he\\r\\ncould go and locate the other tree if he wished while I would go to\\r\\ncamp and be getting grub ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about three-quarters of an hour Smoky came to camp and began\\r\\nwashing for dinner and said not a word. When I saw that Smoky would\\r\\nnot talk, I said, \"Well, Smoky, did you find the other bee tree?\" He\\r\\nsaid, \"Oh! you keep right on baking flapjacks.\" Well, after Smoky\\r\\nregained his speech and told how blamed bright I was, he was going to\\r\\ngo right to work and take out the honey from one of the trees at\\r\\nonce. I told him that as we had no screen to put over his face, the\\r\\nbees would sting him to death, and that he had better wait until\\r\\nearly the next morning when it was frosty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky said that he would not go without honey for the flapjacks when\\r\\nwe had two bee trees so close to the camp. So he took an old burlap\\r\\nand removed every other thread in a space of about ten inches square,\\r\\nmaking a sort of an open-work to cover his face, then pulling the\\r\\nsack over his head and buttoning his coat close up about his throat\\r\\nSmoky was ready for the fray.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cut the birch tree, the one that I had located, that tree being a\\r\\nlittle closer to camp. There was over a hundred pounds of honey in\\r\\nthe tree and we had only one large pail in the camp, and that we had\\r\\nto have to use as a water pail. The tree did not break in falling so\\r\\nas to break up the honey and waste it. While we cut a large beech\\r\\ntree and took a block of about four feet long and split it in half\\r\\nand dug out two large troughs to hold the honey, which was very nice,\\r\\nbeing nearly all white honey, and Smoky said, \"Old Golden, won\\'t we\\r\\nlive high now, rabbit, partridge, baked potatoes, buckwheat flapjacks\\r\\nand honey to swim in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now the 20th of October. I told Smoky that we would go up the\\r\\ncreek a mile above camp and put out the bee bait, burn more honey\\r\\ncomb, and leave the bee box on the stand and await results. In the\\r\\nmeantime we would take a couple of bear traps and go on to a ridge\\r\\nand set them. It might be possible that we would get a bear, although\\r\\nwe had not seen any bear signs on what ground we had been over. We\\r\\ntook the traps, Smoky carrying them, while I carried the bait. The\\r\\nhill was high and rough and I found it about all that I was able to\\r\\ndo to climb although I went very slow and rested often. I did not\\r\\ncomplain, for Smoky was doing all the complaining necessary for both\\r\\nof us. He said that we would not catch a darn thing unless it was a\\r\\ncold, and he didn\\'t think that we would get that much. It proved\\r\\nlater that Smoky was wrong in his reckonings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe set the two bear traps in as likely places as we could find for\\r\\nbear to travel, and put in the balance of the day traveling through\\r\\nthe woods in search of bear signs. Not a track or sign could we find,\\r\\nand when we reached camp at night I was seemingly more dead than\\r\\nalive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning after we had left the bee bait on the old road bed\\r\\nand then climbed the hill to set the two bear traps, Smoky said that\\r\\nwe would go down to Hull\\'s, a distance of about three miles, and see\\r\\nif he could get cans to put the extracted honey in. We had made a\\r\\nsack from two towels and had begun to strain or extract the honey\\r\\nfrom the comb and had the water pail nearly full of strained honey,\\r\\nand were sorely in need of the pail to carry water in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got to where we had left the bee bait, on the old road bed, I\\r\\nfound plenty of bees at work. I soon got the line which went up the\\r\\nstream and a little to the left of the road and directly toward two\\r\\nlarge soft maple trees, the only trees of any size in that direction\\r\\nfor a long distance. I said to myself, a quick job for you must be in\\r\\none or the other of those maples. I left the bait and went to look\\r\\nfor the bees in one of the two trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to the trees, bees came to me in great numbers, but I\\r\\ncould not see a bee going in or out in either. I was satisfied that\\r\\nthe bees were in one of the trees, but after looking for a long time\\r\\nI thought that I must be mistaken, that the bees were farther on and\\r\\nup on the side of the hill. I gave it up and moved the bait up the\\r\\nroad to a point about opposite where the line would strike the\\r\\nhillside and where several trees were left standing, making a good\\r\\nopening by cutting away the brush. I then released the bees from the\\r\\nbox. After they had done much circling I was quite sure I saw two or\\r\\nthree of them swing back in the direction of the soft maple trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left the box and went along the creek in search of mink or coon\\r\\nsigns, so as to give the bees time to get the bait well located, as\\r\\nthey will then fly so much steadier and without doing so much\\r\\ncircling. When I returned to the bait, the bees were flying steadily\\r\\nin the direction of the two soft maples and there could be no mistake\\r\\nthis time. I took the bait down and placed it in the road opposite\\r\\nthe two soft maples and began the second time to search the trees.\\r\\nAfter looking a long time without seeing bees going to or from the\\r\\ntrees, I was again compelled to give it up. I began searching among\\r\\nthe old timber, old stumps and stubs, as it was in the midst of an\\r\\nold bark slashing. I would search among the old down trees a while\\r\\nand then look over the two soft maples.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had kept up this search from 9 o\\'clock in the morning until 2\\r\\no\\'clock in the afternoon. When I was approaching the two maple trees\\r\\nfrom the southwest side I readily discovered bees going into the tree\\r\\nclose to and just above a large branch or prong of the tree which\\r\\nmade it impossible to see them until the sun was just in the right\\r\\nposition to shine square on the place where the bees entered the\\r\\ntree.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my younger days I always carried a pair of climbers and a rope, so\\r\\nthat when I found it difficult to locate the particular tree that the\\r\\nbees were in, when they were in thick timber, I could climb any tree\\r\\nno difference how large and locate the bees. This would often save\\r\\nmuch time in finding a bee tree. I would often climb a tree that\\r\\nstood in a favorable place on the bee line and cut off the top of the\\r\\ntree and make the bee stand up 30 or 40 feet from the ground. This I\\r\\nfound a great advantage in lining bees in a thick, bushy section.\\r\\nThat day is past with me for I am too clumsy to climb any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got to camp, I found Smoky at work putting the honey that was\\r\\nstrained into cans and he said that he had concluded to change his\\r\\nname from Smoky Jim to Sticky Jim. We concluded to let bee hunting go\\r\\nfor a day or two and set two more bear traps south of camp, although\\r\\nwe had seen no signs of bear. Hear I will mention one of Smoky\\'s dry\\r\\nremarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took two bear traps and bait for them following up a hollow south\\r\\nfrom camp to the top of a ridge where there was quite a large clump\\r\\nof green timber still standing. When we came to the head of the\\r\\nhollow and near the top of the ridge where we thought would be a good\\r\\nplace to set a bear trap, I pointed to a small scraggly beech sapling\\r\\nand told Smoky to cut it. Then to cut off a piece six or eight feet\\r\\nlong for a clog. Also to measure the size of the ring in the trap\\r\\nchain and cut the clog off so that when the ring was put down over\\r\\nthe end of the clog, sixteen or eighteen inches to a prong, it would\\r\\nfit the ring fairly close. This would make the ring or chain secure\\r\\nto the clog, as it would give the ring no chance to work about, while\\r\\nI would make a bed to set the trap in and have the trap set by the\\r\\ntime that he got the clog ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now that I found that Smoky had brought a small hatchet\\r\\nweighing less than one-half pound instead of the larger belt axe, but\\r\\nthere was nothing to do only to cut the clog with the little hatchet.\\r\\nSo Smoky went to work cutting the clog while I went to setting the\\r\\ntraps. After a while Smoky came with the clog and he had cut it off\\r\\nwhere it was considerably too large for the ring in the chain. I\\r\\nsaid, \"Smoky, I guess you did not size that ring or the clog very\\r\\nmuch for you have got it much too large.\" Smoky replied readily, \"Yes\\r\\nI did too, the tree has grown that much since I began to chop it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time we managed to get the two traps set and got back to\\r\\ncamp. That night about 10 o\\'clock, Smoky woke me with a punch in the\\r\\nribs and at the same time saying, \"Get your gun, the whole Siwash\\r\\ntribe of Indians are on us.\" On the impulse of the moment I though\\r\\nSmoky was right for I could hear many voices and the barking and\\r\\nsnarling of dogs. In a moment all that had ever happened to me and\\r\\nmany things that never did, nor can happen, passed through my mind\\r\\nbut it was only for a moment when some one called out at the tent\\r\\ndoor saying, \"Get up, you have visitors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe asked who was there and the reply was, \"Oh get up, two sleeps is\\r\\nbetter than one any time.\" I got up and put on my pants and unbuckled\\r\\nthe tent door and there stood a half dozen men and as many more dogs.\\r\\nTwo of the men had a large demijohn strung on a pole and they were\\r\\ncarrying it on their shoulders, two more of the men had coons slung\\r\\nover their shoulders. The boys said that they were out coon hunting\\r\\nand by chance ran into our camp and thought that they would call on\\r\\nus and learn what we were doing. The demijohn contained cider, and\\r\\nthe barking of the dogs was caused by getting into trouble over\\r\\nscraps that had been thrown about camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe invited the boy in and asked them to tell what luck they had had\\r\\nhunting coon. They said that they had only got the two coons on their\\r\\nway up, but thought that they would do better on their way back down\\r\\nthe creek. The boys lived about six miles down the stream. The creek\\r\\nran close along the wagon road nearly all the way so the boys would\\r\\nfollow along the road allowing the dogs to hunt along the creek for\\r\\ncoon. The boys concluded to stay and eat their lunch before starting\\r\\nback. We made them a cup of hot coffee and set out a plate of honey\\r\\nand the boys ate their lunch, drank cider, and told stories until\\r\\nnearly 1 o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey said that they had had a dandy time hunting coon along the last\\r\\nof September while coon were working on the corn and they said that\\r\\nthey had killed about 30 and one wildcat. I asked if they did not\\r\\nthink September rather early in the season to kill coon? They said\\r\\nthat they thought that there was as much sport in it in September as\\r\\nat any other time of the year. I asked if there was any more sport in\\r\\ncoon hunting in September than there was later in the season? They\\r\\nsaid that they did not know that there was. I replied that then they\\r\\nwere out at least one-half or more on the price of the skins. They\\r\\nreplied that it would be a queer jay that would put off a coon hunt a\\r\\nmonth for the difference that there might be in the price of a coon\\r\\nskin. I saw that I was up against it and that my argument had no\\r\\nweight in the matter, so I dropped it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen told that we were putting in our time mostly hunting bees, the\\r\\nboys said that we were losing the best time of our lives by not\\r\\nhaving some good coon dogs along with us, and Smoky quite agreed with\\r\\nthem. However, I could not see it in that light. After the boys left,\\r\\nSmoky and I had to laugh over the boys\\' jolly time until near\\r\\ndaybreak before we could get to sleep again and we quite agreed with\\r\\nthe boys that the second sleep was better than the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now the first of November and we had not put out any small\\r\\ntraps, as the weather was still very warm and dry for the season of\\r\\nthe year. Each day we could see away off to the southwest by the\\r\\nblack heavy smoke that the forest fires that had been burning in that\\r\\ndirection were coming nearer and nearer to us. Smoky said that he\\r\\nthought that a coon skin in October was worth as much as in November.\\r\\nHe said by the time that we could get our traps out the forest fires\\r\\nwould have the whole country burned over and all the game driven out.\\r\\nSmoky was not far from the mark in his prophesying.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now began to put out the small traps at as good a \"jag\" as I was\\r\\nable to stand the travel. We had, while bee hunting at odd times,\\r\\nselected and prepared many of the sets so that we were now able to\\r\\nset out many more traps in a day than we could have done had we not\\r\\nfixed and selected many places for sets. The fourth day of November\\r\\nwas a very warm day in Potter County, and as we had not tried to get\\r\\nany bees west of camp, I told Smoky that we had better let the\\r\\nbalance of the traps go for a day and try the bees in that direction\\r\\nas it was not likely that we would have many more days that bees\\r\\nwould fly during the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went about one-half mile west of camp and put out the bee bait and\\r\\nburned more comb. It was not long before a bee came to the bait and\\r\\nthen another and another, until we had several at work. As soon as\\r\\nthe first bee that came was loaded up and began to make preparations\\r\\nto go, I told Smoky to keep a good eye on him to see which way he\\r\\nwent, as the quicker we got a line the quicker we could move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the bee first started from the bait, he jagged off east, then he\\r\\ncircled so that neither Smoky nor I could tell which way he went. I\\r\\ntold Smoky that I was afraid that the bee went back up the creek\\r\\ntoward a tree we had already found. Smoky said that he did not know\\r\\nwhat made me think so, for no one could tell which direction that bee\\r\\nwent. I told Smoky that I had always noticed that the way that the\\r\\nbee first started when leaving the bait was pretty sure to be in the\\r\\ndirection of the tree and to get in position so that he could see\\r\\nwell if the bee should fly back up the creek as we had no time to\\r\\nspare on bees flying in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before we had bees a-plenty and they came from a tree\\r\\nthat we had already found. I told Smoky that we would leave some bait\\r\\nthere so that those bees would not follow us, and we would move down\\r\\nthe creek some distance before we would try for more. We moved nearly\\r\\na mile, and while I was fixing a stand--there was no stump or good\\r\\nplace to set the box--so I cut a stick about four feet long, an inch\\r\\nin diameter and split the top end into four parts, or in other words\\r\\nquartered the stick, then with two small sticks the size of a lead\\r\\npencil, pressed down in between these quarters. It spread them so as\\r\\nto form plenty of space to set the box on. The other end of the stick\\r\\nis sharpened to drive firmly into the ground. As I was about to say,\\r\\nwhile I was fixing the stand, Smoky discovered a bee working on a\\r\\nwitch-hazel bush close by the stand. Smoky said that he thought that\\r\\nthe bee must have the rheumatism and was gathering Pond\\'s Extract to\\r\\nbathe his joints in (it is with this shrub that Pond\\'s Extract is\\r\\nmade) and this was the cause of Smoky making the remark, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was necessary to burn comb here as we soon had three or four bees\\r\\nat work on the bait and in a short time we had bees a-plenty. They\\r\\nflew just to the right of the wagon road in a westerly direction and\\r\\non to the side of a very steep hill where there was considerable\\r\\nstanding timber. We soon got the course of the bees\\' flight, but\\r\\nthere seemed to be two lines, as some of the bees would fly to the\\r\\nleft of a large tree that stood Just on the bank of the road, while\\r\\nothers would fly to the right of the tree. This caused Smoky to\\r\\nremark that we had another sticky job on our hands, saying that there\\r\\nwas two different lines. I told Smoky that I thought not. It was all\\r\\nthe same bees and that the bees would soon all be flying to the left\\r\\nor lower side of the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky wished to know how I made that out. I explained that I thought\\r\\nthe bees were around the point of the hill and up a side draft that\\r\\ncame into the main hollow some sixty rods below where we were and\\r\\nthat the bees that were flying to the right of the tree flew in a\\r\\ndirect line to the tree by flying up over the point of the hill then\\r\\ndown into the hollow; those that flew to the left of the tree flew\\r\\naround the point of the hill and up the hollow to their tree. Smoky\\r\\nlaughed at my idea and said that bees always flew in a straight\\r\\nline--does not everybody say as straight as a bee-line?\\r\\n\\r\\nI told Smoky that was all very well in a level and open country. That\\r\\na bee knew that it was no farther around the rim of a kettle than up\\r\\nover the bail; that a bee was far too wise to carry a load up over a\\r\\nhill when he could get there in the same distance on a level; that\\r\\nbees in their flight would often vary their course and fly along the\\r\\nside of a hill to keep out of a strong wind until they were nearly\\r\\nopposite the tree, when they would make nearly a square turn to the\\r\\ntree. That they would also vary their flight from a straight line to\\r\\nfollow an opening as a road cut out through the thick woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight of the bees, as I suspected, was soon all to the left of\\r\\nthe tree standing on the bank of the road. We moved the bait down to\\r\\nthe mouth of the side draft and soon had a line flying nearly up the\\r\\nhollow. I told Smoky to take the bees some forty rods up the hollow\\r\\nand make a stand while I would follow and inspect the trees that\\r\\nlooked favorable. Soon Smoky halloed to me and said that the bees had\\r\\nnearly all left him. I told him to make the stand where he was. As he\\r\\nhad passed the tree that was the cause of the bees dropping off all\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust below where Smoky was and a little up on the bank from the\\r\\nhollow stood a large maple tree. I started to inspect the tree. Bees\\r\\nwere flying all about me and as soon as I was near enough to the tree\\r\\nto see, I could see bees flying all about the tree, some forty feet\\r\\nfrom the ground. I called to Smoky and told him that the bees were\\r\\ntreed in a large maple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was on the fourth day of November and was a very rare thing for\\r\\nbees to be working at that time of the year in this section of the\\r\\ncountry. This tree made the sixth bee tree that we had found while in\\r\\ncamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ended our bee hunting and we now put in the balance of the time,\\r\\nwhile in camp, with the traps. It will now be necessary to go back to\\r\\nthe 20th of October to a time that Smoky said was the biggest day of\\r\\nhis life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 20th of October we started out to look at the bear traps with\\r\\nlittle hopes of getting anything more than a porcupine. Up to this\\r\\ntime we had not seen any signs of bear, only what had been made\\r\\nduring the summer, where the bear had dug out woodchucks and torn old\\r\\nlogs to pieces in search of grubs, and where they had dug wild\\r\\nturnips. These signs were so old that we had but little hopes of\\r\\ngetting a bear while in camp and Smoky was continually condemning the\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went up along a hollow that led to the top of a high ridge where\\r\\nwe had a bear trap setting and where I thought was the most likely\\r\\nplace to catch a bear, but found the trap undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe next crossed a narrow ridge where we had another trap. The trap\\r\\nwas set in a spring run and the banks on either side of the run were\\r\\nquite thickly grown up with low brush. Smoky was in advance a few\\r\\nsteps so that when he came to the edge of the thick brush that grew\\r\\non the bank of the run, parted the brush and looked through at the\\r\\ntrap, he caught a glimpse of some black object moving in the run. He\\r\\nquickly stepped back and held up his hand, his eyes sparkling with\\r\\nexcitement and he whispered to me, \"By Moses, we have got him.\" Smoky\\r\\nbeing given to much joking, I asked, \"What have we got?\" for I had\\r\\nnot heard any noise of any kind. Smoky said, \"A bear, by long horn\\r\\nspoon-handle.\" I stepped past Smoky and looked through the brush and\\r\\nthere was a large black porcupine moving about a little in the trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stepped back and said to Smoky, \"Well, shoot him.\" Smoky said, \"No,\\r\\nI will miss him. You shoot him,\" at the same time handing me the gun.\\r\\nI now saw that Smoky was in earnest and surely thought we had a bear\\r\\nand I burst out with laughter. Smoky was amazed and said, \"You\\r\\nblooming simpleton, what is the matter with you?\" The look of anxiety\\r\\nand the manner in which Smoky spoke still caused me to laugh the\\r\\nharder.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I could cease laughing long enough to tell Smoky what was in the\\r\\ntrap, Smoky\\'s change of looks of excitement and anxiety to one of\\r\\ndisgust was pitiful. Smoky began to condemn the country and tell how\\r\\nfoolish we were to come to such a forsaken place as that was to trap\\r\\nwhere there was nothing but porcupines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter resetting the trap we went on to the third trap, which was\\r\\nsetting about a mile farther north. It was necessary to cross two\\r\\nnarrow ridges in order to reach the trap. Smoky was in a moody state\\r\\nof mind and lagged along behind, hunting partridges, killing two or\\r\\nthree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached the top of the second ridge and the trap was in the\\r\\nhollow beyond, I heard some sort of a noise where the trap was\\r\\nsetting, but I was unable to tell what it was. Smoky was behind\\r\\nsomewhere on the line, but while I stood listening he came on in\\r\\ngreat haste. He had heard the same noise and was hurrying up to\\r\\ninquire what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him that I was unable to tell just what it was, but was afraid\\r\\nthat some dog had got caught in the trap as the sound came from the\\r\\ndirection in which the trap was. Smoky said that it was a different\\r\\nnoise than he had ever heard a dog make.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told Smoky that I feared that it was some hound that was in the\\r\\ntrap and was making the pitiful sort of a howl and that we must hurry\\r\\non and get him out of the trap. When we were half way down the side\\r\\nof the hill, the noise ceased, but I could now see that the noise\\r\\ncame from some distance farther down the run than where the trap had\\r\\nbeen set and I knew that no dog could move the trap and clog. We now\\r\\nwent a little more quietly. I soon got sight of Bruin rolling and\\r\\ntumbling in a bunch of small birch saplings where the trap clog was\\r\\nfast, good and stout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky had not got his eye onto the bear yet, when I stopped and\\r\\npointed in the direction of the bear and said, \"Smoky, there is the\\r\\ngentleman that you have been so anxious to see.\" Smoky had not yet\\r\\ngot his eye onto the bear and he said, \"That\\'s no darned dog that\\r\\nmakes that noise. What is it? I don\\'t see anything.\" \"No, Smoky, it\\r\\nis no dog; neither is it a porky; it is a bear this time all right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pointed at the clump of yellow birches and said, \"Don\\'t you see him\\r\\ndown in the gulch there?\" When Smoky got his eye on the bear, you\\r\\nshould have seen them sparkle. This was the first bear that Smoky had\\r\\never seen outside of captivity. When I told Smoky that we would go up\\r\\nclose to the bear and he (Smoky) should shoot it, he again reached\\r\\nthe gun to me and again insisted that I should shoot it, saying that\\r\\nhe would surely miss it, the same as he declared in the case of the\\r\\nporcupine. I told Smoky that he had plenty of cartridges and that it\\r\\nwould be some time before it would be too dark to see to shoot and\\r\\nthat he must shoot the bear. It took a great deal of urging to get\\r\\nSmoky to shoot, he declaring all the time that he knew he would miss\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, \"Smoky, you must not shoot at the bear but at the base of the\\r\\nbear\\'s ear,\" which he finally did and Bruin was out of his trouble\\r\\nalmost before the smoke from the rifle had cleared away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear was a large one, measuring seven feet two inches from end to\\r\\nend. We were unable to get it out of the woods whole. Smoky insisted\\r\\nthat he would carry it if it was as large as a mountain. He soon gave\\r\\nup that idea and we cut the carcass into pieces and took part to camp\\r\\nand returned the next day after the balance. That night after we got\\r\\nto camp with the bear we had for supper bear steak, partridge, rabbit\\r\\nand bacon with warm biscuits and honey, baked potatoes, butter and\\r\\ncoffee, with the necessary trimmings, which caused Smoky to remark\\r\\nthat the country was all right for a living, but thought that society\\r\\nwas rather limited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after we had brought in the remainder of the bear, we could\\r\\nsee the smoke from the forest fires that were burning away to the\\r\\nsouthwest, loom up thick and black. It was plainly to be seen that\\r\\nthe fire was steadily working in the direction of our camp and was\\r\\ngetting in close proximity to where we had a bear trap setting. I was\\r\\nafraid that the fire would burn sufficiently hard to spoil the trap\\r\\nunless it was taken up, so Smoky said that if I would \"mix the\\r\\nmuligan\" (get supper) that he would go and get the trap, which I\\r\\nreadily consented to do, telling Smoky to bring the trap down to a\\r\\nsmall creek and put the trap in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky got back about the time I had supper ready. He came in and put\\r\\nhis gun up and washed ready for supper without saying a word. I saw\\r\\nthat Smoky was looking down-hearted but thought that he was a little\\r\\ntired and homesick, so I did not say much to him, but after a little\\r\\nI said, \"Charley, did you get anything in the trap?\" He answered very\\r\\nshort, saying, \"If I had you would be likely to see something of it,\\r\\nwouldn\\'t you?\" so I said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper was over and the dishes washed, Smoky took a piece of\\r\\npaper from his pocket and handed it to me with the remark, \"What do\\r\\nyou know about that?\" I unfolded the paper and found that it\\r\\ncontained a lock of bear\\'s hair. I said, \"Smoky, what is it? Another\\r\\none of your jokes?\" I thought that Smoky had taken the hair from the\\r\\nbear that we had caught two days before. Smoky remarked that he\\r\\nthought that the joke was on him as much as anyone, and then\\r\\nexplained that a bear had been in the trap and he got out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe described the circumstances, and it was plain to be seen that the\\r\\nguide or stepping stick had been placed a little too close to the\\r\\ntrap which had caused the bear to step his foot partly over on to the\\r\\njaw of the trap and had only been caught by the heel, which was not\\r\\nsufficient to hold him, although Smoky said that the bear had put up\\r\\nquite a fight before it had got out. Smoky said that when he came to\\r\\nwhere the trap was set and found it gone, he thought he would have\\r\\nthe biggest time of his life. A bear all by himself, and when he\\r\\nfound that the bear had got away, he felt like throwing himself into\\r\\nthe creek along with the trap. I told Charley not to take the matter\\r\\nto heart so, for if he followed the trap line and the trail very long\\r\\nthat he would have many a slip just at the time that he thought he\\r\\nhad the game bagged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the fire was sweeping over the whole country so we\\r\\nhustled around and pulled all of the traps that were not setting in\\r\\nthe water or that were not out of reach of the fire. The fire put an\\r\\nend to trapping for everything but a few mink along the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to speak of one of Smoky\\'s dry remarks. Smoky is a strong\\r\\nRepublican. A few days after the Presidential election we were going\\r\\nup a small draft to look after three or four traps that I had set for\\r\\nfox. The first trap that we came to was undisturbed. The second one\\r\\nwas lying at the side of the brook all in a bunch, chain and all.\\r\\nPlain to be seen that it had been dropped there by human hands. As\\r\\nsoon as I saw the trap I said, \"Smoky, some one has dropped that trap\\r\\nthere.\" \"There has been some animal in it and it has gotten out, see,\\r\\nthere is blood on the jaws.\" \"Very true, Smoky, there has been some\\r\\nanimal in the trap, but human hands took it out, for no animal leaves\\r\\na trap, clog and all, lying free in that way, with the trap chain\\r\\nslack in that way.\" It only required a glance about to see that there\\r\\nhad been a coon in the trap and had been fast. Just up on the bank\\r\\nthere lay the club that they had used to kill the coon with. After\\r\\ngiving my opinion of the gentleman that had taken the coon, I began\\r\\nto reset the trap again where it was before.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky objected to again setting the trap there only for some one else\\r\\nto get the game again, but I told Smoky that lightning rarely struck\\r\\ntwice in the same place so we would set the trap again. We started up\\r\\nthe hollow and were soon discussing politics again until we came to\\r\\nwhere the next trap was setting. Just before we came to the trap,\\r\\nSmoky picked up an empty cartridge shell. A few yards farther on lay\\r\\nthe second trap which had had a fox in it, as was plain to be seen by\\r\\nthe tooth marks on the small brush and by the fur on the trap. That\\r\\nthe fox had been shot was evident by the amount of fur that was lying\\r\\non the ground where the animal had been caught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was more than I could stand without giving vent to my feelings.\\r\\nAfter trying for some time to find words to give the case justice,\\r\\nand failing, Smoky remarked with all the coolness imaginable, that\\r\\nthere was one thing certain about it, that it was a Democrat that\\r\\ntook the fox and coon. I was astonished at the remark and asked what\\r\\nhe meant. \"Well, if it had been a Republican that had taken them, he\\r\\nwould have taken the traps, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now getting our trap line down to a few traps along the main\\r\\ncreek, and we now worked those traps to the best of our skill, as we\\r\\nwished to get our share of the mink. We had not put out any mink\\r\\ntraps until the first of November. The weather had been very dry and\\r\\nwarm but as it had now turned cold and I found that I could not stand\\r\\nthe cold as I once could, I told Smoky that we would take what mink\\r\\npelts we could get in a few days and pull stakes. Smoky replied that\\r\\nthat sort of \"chin music\" suited him. So after ten or twelve days of\\r\\nmink trapping we pulled the rest of the traps and went home, having\\r\\nto my idea a pleasant time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoky agreed that the time was all right but he thought that the\\r\\nsociety was a little slow for him, saying that if it had not been for\\r\\nthe boys on the coon hunt we would not have seen a half dozen persons\\r\\nsince we had been in camp. We had not made a large catch of furs but\\r\\nI thought that we had done fairly well, all things considered (one\\r\\nold played-out trapper and a kid who had never set a trap for\\r\\nanything greater than a muskrat or a ground hog).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS CATCH.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had caught while in camp one bear, ten mink, eight coon and some\\r\\nother furs as shown in the accompanying picture. After we left I set\\r\\na few traps about home, catching three fox and a few skunk and four\\r\\nmore mink, making fourteen mink in all. We got $4 and $4.50 for the\\r\\nfox, and $4 to $6 for the mink, and from 80 cents to $2.25 for skunk,\\r\\nand about the same for coon. We got 30 to 40 cents each for muskrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will about complete the story of my trapping for the season of\\r\\n1908. I am sorry that I am no artist, as I could have sent some fine\\r\\npictures, consisting of the bear in trap, as well as many other\\r\\nanimals in traps, and other pictures that would have been interesting\\r\\nhad I been able to take them at the right time and place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nHits and Misses on the Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany years ago when deer were plenty in this section of the country\\r\\n(North Central Pennsylvania) and dogs were allowed to run deer at\\r\\ntheir will, there being no restriction by way of law against hounding\\r\\ndeer, I started from the house about 10 o\\'clock in the morning to go\\r\\nto some traps that I had set for mink along the creek in a swamp not\\r\\nfar from our place. There was an old road or path that led from the\\r\\nwagon road down through the swamp to the creek. Along this path it\\r\\nwas thickly grown up with laurel and other underbrush that nearly\\r\\nshut out the path.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was accustomed to follow this path to the creek when going to look\\r\\nafter my traps. On my way up to the road I heard dogs barking as\\r\\nthough they were on the trail of something, but thought nothing of it\\r\\nas it was a common occurrence to hear hounds running nearly every\\r\\nday. I was following this path and had got within a few rods of the\\r\\ncreek and was just about ready to climb over a fallen tree that lay\\r\\nacross the path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tree lay up from the ground about a foot or so and it was perhaps\\r\\nthree feet from the ground up to the top of the log. I was just in\\r\\nthe act of climbing this log when a good-sized buck deer went to jump\\r\\nthe log also and we met, head on. I had no gun and if I had would\\r\\nhave had no time to use it. I seized the deer by the horns and forced\\r\\nhim back from the log with a startled cry at the same time. The deer,\\r\\ninstead of trying to get away, seemed bound to come over the log to\\r\\nwhere I was, so I held to the deer\\'s horns, not daring to let loose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could keep him from raising over the log and after he tried several\\r\\ntimes to jump the log, he then tried to break loose from me, but I\\r\\nhad the advantage of the deer owing to the log being so high that the\\r\\ndeer could not pull me over, neither could the deer get in shape to\\r\\nstrike me with his feet under the log. I think that I was so badly\\r\\nfrightened at the sudden meeting with the deer, that I did not know\\r\\nwhat to do so I hung tight to the buck\\'s horns and called as loud as\\r\\nI could for help, thinking that some one might possibly be passing\\r\\nalong the road, which was not so far away, hear my call and come to\\r\\nmy assistance, but no one came. A man by the name of Nelson lived\\r\\nabout a fourth of a mile away, who had a large bulldog. The dog\\'s\\r\\nname was Turk. This dog would follow me at every chance that he could\\r\\nget. As no assistance came, I had about made up my mind to release my\\r\\nhold on the deer as my strength was fast leaving me, when I thought\\r\\nto call for Turk. I began calling as loud as I could and it seemed\\r\\nthat the dog had heard my calling before I began, for almost before I\\r\\nwas aware of his presence the dog sprang over the log and seized the\\r\\ndeer by the hind leg, but the dog had barely grabbed the deer when\\r\\nthe deer kicked him away from the path into the laurel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an instant the dog, with an angry yelp, jumped and seized the deer\\r\\nby the throat and in a moment the deer ceased to struggle and began\\r\\nto settle to the ground. As soon as I dared to release my hold on the\\r\\ndeer\\'s horns I got my pocket knife out and sprang over the log and\\r\\nran the knife blade into the deer\\'s throat. The deer did not seem to\\r\\nnotice the knife. I think that the dog had choked the life out of\\r\\nhim. The battle was over and it was only a few minutes but it was the\\r\\nhardest battle that I ever had and the dog came to my assistance none\\r\\ntoo soon for I could not have held on much longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not end the fight, for I had hardly begun to dress the deer\\r\\nbefore two dogs that were in pursuit of the deer came up. I was\\r\\ncompelled to use sticks, stones and clubs to break up a fight between\\r\\nthe bulldog and the hounds, though I finally got the row broke up and\\r\\ndrove the hounds off in order to keep peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoys, I am not sure whether the incident just related would be called\\r\\na hit or a miss. I will tell of an incident that I call a hit. A man\\r\\nby the name of Wells and a brother of mine were camping near the old\\r\\nJersey Shore turnpike and were trapping, also hunting deer. One day\\r\\nthey had been off on the west side of the turnpike setting marten\\r\\ntraps and had built a number of deadfalls and had also set several\\r\\nsteel traps for foxes. On their way home to camp they had to cross\\r\\nseveral low ridges which were good sections for deer. It was nearly\\r\\nsundown and just the right time for deer to be on their feet feeding\\r\\nso we spread out along one of the ridges in hopes that some of us\\r\\nmight get a shot. There was a good tracking snow and deer tracks were\\r\\nplenty. We were on the last ridge before we dropped off into the\\r\\nhollow to where the camp was and it was beginning to get dark in the\\r\\nheavy timber. I had come out onto a short spur of the ridge and was\\r\\nstanding looking over the ground very carefully to see if I could not\\r\\nsee a deer feeding, when I heard a shot fired by one of the boys. In\\r\\na few moments a bunch of five or six deer came in sight, making their\\r\\nway around the point at breakneck speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened fire on the bunch without taking aim at any particular deer,\\r\\nas it was too dark to get down to real business and the deer were in\\r\\ntoo much of a hurry to change their feeding grounds to give me very\\r\\nmuch of a show. I was not stingy of my ammunition and pumped lead at\\r\\nthe bunch as long as I could guess where the deer were. As soon as I\\r\\nhad ceased to waste ammunition I heard my brother calling for me.\\r\\nWhen I got to him he was at work taking the entrails out of a good\\r\\nsized buck. We dragged the deer down to where the deer were when I\\r\\nbegan shooting to see if I had chanced to hit one of the bunch. It\\r\\nwas too dark to see much but we found a little blood on the snow in\\r\\none place but concluded that I had not done much damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dragged the buck that my brother had killed to camp, got our\\r\\nsupper and made plans for the next day\\'s work. It was agreed that I\\r\\nshould look after the bunch of deer and see what effect my shots had\\r\\non the deer that we had found that had bled some. I was to work this\\r\\nbunch of deer while the other boys went to look after the marten\\r\\ntraps, being quite sure that there would be a marten or two in the\\r\\ntraps, for we had built some deadfalls where we saw fresh marten\\r\\nsigns quite plenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning I was up early and had breakfast before daylight and\\r\\nready to start out and carry out the work as already planned. It was\\r\\nabout one-fourth of a mile from camp to the turnpike and as the deer\\r\\nwhich I was going to look for were making their course, the last I\\r\\nhad seen them, in the direction of the road, I was going to go to the\\r\\nroad and then go north along the road to see if they had crossed. The\\r\\nboys would take the same path to the road that I did when they would\\r\\ngo south of camp to look after the marten traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had my gun and stood in the cabin door waiting for my brother and\\r\\nWells to get ready as I would accompany them as far as the road. The\\r\\nboys were having some trouble belting their leggins and creepers on\\r\\nto their satisfaction. I became tired of waiting and made the remark\\r\\nthat I could go and kill a deer before they could get their feet\\r\\ndressed. My brother said that I had better be going then, so I\\r\\nstarted on up the path to the road. It was thawing a little, just\\r\\nenough to make the snow pack. I had gone about a hundred yards from\\r\\ncamp when I saw a track of a deer where it had stepped into the path,\\r\\nthen had turned back about forty yards to the left of the path. A\\r\\nlarge birch tree had blown down, knocking one or two smaller trees\\r\\ndown so that it made a little jam. Seeing that the tracks were so\\r\\nfresh I knew that the deer was close by and as the woods were open I\\r\\nwas quite positive that the deer must be about the jam of trees, when\\r\\na large doe stepped out in sight and it was only the work of a moment\\r\\nto let her down in her tracks. When the gun cracked out jumped a\\r\\nyearling buck that was lying down just in the edge of the jam and\\r\\nbounded over the trunk of a large birch and stopped broadside to me\\r\\nand I let him down. Thinking of what I had said on leaving the cabin\\r\\nand what my brother had said to me I ran back to camp as quick as I\\r\\ncould go without even stopping to cut the deer\\'s throat. As I came\\r\\naround the corner of the cabin I heard my brother say to Wells, \"I\\r\\nbet a gander that he has killed a deer all right, for he would not\\r\\nshoot twice so quick at anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, the boys had not got their feet dressed yet, but chance had\\r\\nallowed me to make my word good only I had killed two deer instead of\\r\\none. The boys helped me to hang up the deer and then went to the\\r\\nmarten traps while I went in search of the deer I had started after.\\r\\nSoon I struck the trail of the deer and shortly saw that one of them\\r\\nhad a broken leg and I did not follow the trail far when the wounded\\r\\ndeer dropped out and left the others. I began doing the creeping act\\r\\nand soon found the deer lying on his trail. I hung the deer up and\\r\\nwent back to camp thinking that I had enough sport for one day and\\r\\nwould let well enough alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the boys came in at night they brought in two marten skins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nLost in the Woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne writer contends that the pocket compass is but very little use to\\r\\na man in a dense forest. This, I think, depends largely upon\\r\\ncircumstances. While the writer has spent a good portion of fifty\\r\\nyears almost continuously in the woods, he has seldom found it\\r\\nnecessary to use a compass to guide him out. Now this is due partly\\r\\nto the natural faculty of locating any particular place. This faculty\\r\\nof locating any certain place or point by giving or knowing the\\r\\nproper direction to take after one has traveled all day or for\\r\\nseveral days in the woods, I am inclined to credit to a sort of\\r\\nnatural instinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have often thought of the story of the Indian who was met by a man\\r\\nin the woods who asked the Indian if he was lost. The reply was, \"No,\\r\\nme ain\\'t lost, wigwam lost, me here.\" Now I can say without boasting\\r\\nthat it is seldom that the camp or a given point gets lost with me,\\r\\nwhile it is not an uncommon occurrence for the writer to get lost or\\r\\nrather bothered himself in a strange locality. But after a moment\\'s\\r\\nthought, I say the camp or the point I wish to reach is in that\\r\\ndirection, and it is not often that I miss my calculation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have had several occasions to search for parties lost in the\\r\\nwoods, I wish to relate a particular instance of one man who was\\r\\nlost. It was an uncle of mine by the name of Nelson, and the writer\\r\\nwent in search of him. To illustrate that those who are lost lose\\r\\ntheir heads as soon as they find that they do not know where they\\r\\nare.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I wish to say that if you lost your course or get bothered in\\r\\nyour bearings, do not lose your head, for if you do you are lost, but\\r\\nkeep cool and keep your head. Sit down and fill your pipe, and while\\r\\nyou smoke draw a map of the country carefully in your mind, and\\r\\nalmost invariably you will locate yourself and in so doing will\\r\\nlocate the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get back to the lost man in question whose name was Amos Fish, and\\r\\nat the time, was the proprietor of the Cherry Springs Hotel, in this\\r\\ncounty. This hotel was located in the heart of the largest forest in\\r\\nPennsylvania, and originally was a great resort for hunters from all\\r\\nover the state as well as southern and western New York. (The time of\\r\\nwhich I write was somewhere in the 60\\'s--have forgotten exact date.)\\r\\nThere were several men boarding at this hotel and my uncle and myself\\r\\nwere among the number boarding with Mr. Fish, hunting, as were other\\r\\nboarders. This hotel stood in the center of a field containing\\r\\nperhaps eighty acres of cleared land, and there was not another\\r\\nclearing or a building within a distance of seven miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning after there had been a fall of four or five inches of\\r\\nsnow, which made fine tracking, Mr. Fish thought that he would go out\\r\\nthat morning and try and kill a deer. He left the house going through\\r\\nthe field in nearly a due east course. After going about one mile he\\r\\ncrossed a stream which ran in a north and south direction. Mr. Fish\\r\\nhad fished this stream for trout many a time. After crossing this\\r\\nstream Mr. Fish crossed a broad ridge and went on to a small stream\\r\\nknown as the Sunken Branch, and a tributary of the stream Mr. Fish\\r\\nhad previously crossed. Now Mr. Fish was fairly well acquainted with\\r\\nthe location which he was in, but in his search for deer he had got a\\r\\nlittle mixed in his whereabout and at once lost his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle when coming in from hunting that evening crossed Mr. Fish\\'s\\r\\ntrack on the ridge near the head of the Sunken Branch, and had heard\\r\\nhim shoot several times but supposed that he was shooting at deer.\\r\\nWhen the hunters all got in that night and Mr. Fish failed to appear,\\r\\nthe matter was discussed by the hunters from all points of view. It\\r\\nwas generally thought that Mr. Fish had had good luck killing deer\\r\\nand had been detained in dressing and hanging them up, or that he had\\r\\nwounded a deer and had been led a long way from home in getting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it got well along in the evening and Mr. Fish failed to come\\r\\nthen it was feared that he had met with some misfortune. No one would\\r\\nbelieve that he was lost, as it was known that he was pretty well\\r\\nacquainted with the woods in the direction that he had been known to\\r\\ntake. But as the time went on and still Mr. Fish did not come, we all\\r\\nbegan to fear for his safety, as the night was very cold, so every\\r\\nfew minutes some one would go out and fire a gun. This was continued\\r\\nall night, though there was no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle and myself had an early breakfast and started some time\\r\\nbefore daybreak for the locality in which uncle had seen Mr. Fish\\'s\\r\\ntracks and heard gun shots which were thought to have been fired by\\r\\nhim. Shortly after daybreak we found the track of a man which we\\r\\ncould readily see had been made during the night. After following the\\r\\ntrack some distance we were convinced that we were following the\\r\\ntrack of Mr. Fish and he was lost, for his tracks would go in a\\r\\nzigzag sort of a circle and crossing his tracks previously made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had followed Mr. Fish\\'s track for an hour or longer we saw\\r\\nhim coming nearly towards us with his hat in his hand. We stood still\\r\\nand he came close to us before he seemed to notice us. He had no gun,\\r\\nand when he stopped he stared at us and did not seem to know us.\\r\\nUncle then spoke to him and said, \"Amos, what is the matter, are you\\r\\nlost?\" Mr. Fish replied that he wanted to go to the Cherry Springs\\r\\nHotel. In a few minutes after eating a good lunch which we had\\r\\ncarried with us for that purpose, he seemed to know us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen questioned as to what he had done with his gun, he apparently\\r\\nhad forgotten that he ever had a gun. But after a time seemed to\\r\\nremember the gun in a vague sort of way, and said that he must have\\r\\nleft it by a tree but could not tell in what direction the tree was.\\r\\nAfter a search of a half hour we found the gun standing by a tree\\r\\nwhere apparently Mr. Fish had traveled around for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came to the creek on our way to the house and at the place\\r\\nwhere Mr. Fish had crossed it in the morning before, he asked what\\r\\nstream it was. When told that it was the place where he had crossed\\r\\nthe creek the morning before and asked if he did not remember the\\r\\ncreek as he had fished there many a time, he said that he had no\\r\\nrecollection of ever seeing the stream before. Shortly we came out\\r\\ninto the field and Mr. Fish did not know his own house. Asked who\\r\\nlived there and did not seem to recognize his own home until he had\\r\\nbeen inside the house for several minutes with his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have related this instance of Mr. Fish to show how necessary it is\\r\\nfor one who has got slightly mixed in his course to keep cool and not\\r\\nallow himself to become excited. If he does he immediately loses his\\r\\nhead and is at once lost, as in the case of Mr. Fish. He was at no\\r\\ntime more than four miles from his house, and was quite familiar with\\r\\nthe ground he was on during the whole time. He was lost while\\r\\nfollowing the deer that he was in pursuit of. They led him into a\\r\\nwindfall perhaps containing one hundred acres, and it was while in\\r\\nthis that he became bothered as to the right course to go to his\\r\\nhouse. He at once lost his head, or more proper, his reasoning\\r\\nfaculties, and at once became lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Fish was east of the ridge and road and as he had a compass, all\\r\\nthere was for him to do was to consult the compass and go west to the\\r\\nroad, but Mr. Fish declared that his compass would not work, and it\\r\\nmight have been possible that he held the compass so close to the gun\\r\\nbarred that the compass did not work properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my more than fifty years\\' life in the woods as a trapper and\\r\\nhunter, it has been my lot to search for several persons lost in the\\r\\nwoods. Once in these same woods I searched for three weeks for a\\r\\nlittle child four years old. At first the search for days was carried\\r\\non by more than a hundred men, then another man and myself continued,\\r\\nthen my companion gave it up. I continued alone for days, but there\\r\\nhas never been a trace of the child seen or heard of, since its\\r\\ngrandmother last saw the little fellow sitting on the door step\\r\\neating a piece of bread and butter on the morning of its\\r\\ndisappearance, along in the early 80\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo speak of the use of the pocket compass, I would say to the trapper\\r\\nor hunter that where he can it is best to locate his camp when in a\\r\\nsection of a country where the woods are very large, and the trapper\\r\\nor hunter is not well acquainted with the locality, on a stream or in\\r\\na valley of considerable size, or near a public highway or some\\r\\nlandmark that is readily recognized by the trapper. Even thought it\\r\\nmay be after nightfall, for the thrifty trapper or hunter will\\r\\noftener find himself on the trail after the stars are shining than he\\r\\nwill in camp before dark. Now it is quite necessary that the camper\\r\\nshould first acquaint himself with these land marks for some distance\\r\\neither side of his camp (when I say some distance I mean miles) and\\r\\nespecially get the general course or direction that the stream runs\\r\\nor other landmarks, for this is where the real use of the pocket\\r\\ncompass comes in play.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when you start out place out a line of traps or on the trail of a\\r\\ndeer or other animal, all that there is to be done is to know whether\\r\\nyou are on the south, north or other direction, as the case may be,\\r\\nfrom this valley or other landmarks. Now the trapper or hunter soon\\r\\nbecomes so accustomed to traveling in the woods that when he makes up\\r\\nhis mind to strike for camp, he can tell about how long it will take\\r\\nhim to reach this valley that the camp is located in. When the time\\r\\ncomes to go to camp consult the compass, and as it is known what\\r\\ndirection to take to hit the camp, or at least the stream or other\\r\\nlandmark on which the camp is located.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, boys, if any one is in the habit of getting lost the pocket\\r\\ncompass is a very useful instrument in finding the way, providing it\\r\\nis properly used. Let me say, however, that no matter how often \"the\\r\\nshanty gets lost,\" don\\'t lose your head, for if you do, the compass\\r\\nor the landmarks will do you no good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraps and Other Hints for Trappers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll trappers have their favorite traps--the writer has his. Every boy\\r\\nknows that the Newhouse trap is at the top of the ladder, as to\\r\\nquality, but as to convenience, well, I prefer the No. 1 1/2 Oneida\\r\\nJump trap, which is superior to all others on the market for small\\r\\ngame. This trap is now made with jaws much thicker than the original\\r\\n\"Jump\" (Blake & Lamb), and the way the chain is now fastened gives\\r\\nthe animal a straight draw instead of a twist, as was the case with\\r\\nthe Blake & Lamb style. The Oneida Jump however, is lacking in\\r\\nstrength of the springs, being much weaker than the Blake & Lamb of\\r\\nthe same size but in all other ways I consider it far better than the\\r\\noriginal Blake & Lamb. The spring being so much weaker than the Blake\\r\\n& Lamb springs were, is a serious drawback, as the Oneida Jump trap\\r\\nof this size will not hold a large raccoon or a large fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while many trappers might not seriously object to the trap on\\r\\nthese grounds as they use many different sizes of traps or a\\r\\ndifferent size of trap for each animal. This I never do in trapper\\r\\nthe smaller animals, for when I make a dry or ground set, I set the\\r\\ntrap for any animal from the fox to the coon or wildcat, although I\\r\\nmay be more particular making the set for mink.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes a trapper feel sore to go to a trap and find that a fox or\\r\\ncoon has been in his trap and escaped. This rarely if ever occurs\\r\\nwhen using the Blake & Lamb No. 1 1/2 trap, or as the original was\\r\\ncalled No. 2, though it had the same spread of jaws as the No. 1 1/2\\r\\nOneida Jump. Now the advantages that the Oneida Jump trap has over\\r\\nthe long spring trap are many. The most desirable are perhaps the\\r\\neasy manner in which the \"jump\" trap can be concealed. In fact, a\\r\\npractical set can be made in certain places where it is entirely\\r\\nimpracticable to make the set with a long spring trap. Another\\r\\nadvantage that the \"jump\" trap has over the bow or long spring trap\\r\\nis its comparison to the long spring trap in shipping by express.\\r\\nThis, if going on a long journey, to your trapping grounds, is not\\r\\nsafe by freight, as the trapping season may be over before your traps\\r\\nreach you. Still another advantage is the amount of room saved in\\r\\npacking, for you can pack two of the \"jump\" traps in the same space\\r\\nrequired to pack one long spring trap. The writer has had a good deal\\r\\nof experience in this matter and knows the difference in handling the\\r\\ntwo makes of traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I do not like to use the double spring \"jump\" trap where I am\\r\\ntrapping, for I might possibly catch a dog or other domestic animal\\r\\nand it is a hard trap to get a live animal out of.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany, perhaps most trappers use the No. 1 trap for trapping mink,\\r\\nmuskrat, marten, etc. The No. 1 Newhouse or Victor is sufficiently\\r\\nstrong for these animals but as I have stated, I do not think this\\r\\nthe best plan if the trapper is operating on grounds where there are\\r\\nlarger animals to be taken, as most frequently the one set can be\\r\\nmade to catch several kinds of animals. I have found also that one is\\r\\nmore liable to catch the animal by the end of the toes in a No. 1\\r\\ntrap than in the No. 1 1/2, but where one is trapping for the\\r\\npurposes of saving the fox, skunk or other animal alive, then the No.\\r\\n1 trap should be used, as the animal is not so liable to break a leg\\r\\nor to hurt the foot so badly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor otter I prefer the single spring Newhouse trap, owing to the fact\\r\\nthat it is more easily concealed than the double spring trap. I see\\r\\nthat a number of writers think that the No. 5 bear trap should have a\\r\\nlarger spread of jaw so as to catch higher on the bear\\'s foot. Now I\\r\\ndo not intend to dictate to others as to what kind of a trap they\\r\\nshould use, not in the least, for I have my own ideas as to traps and\\r\\nguns as well as the manner of using them. Now as for myself, I think\\r\\nthe Newhouse No. 5 bear trap could not be improved, as to spread of\\r\\njaws. The grasp is just right to catch the bear through the thick of\\r\\nthe foot where there is no danger of the bear twisting the foot off.\\r\\nIn case where the trap has a spread of jaws sufficient to grasp above\\r\\nthe foot and for more space for the bear to place his foot well\\r\\nbetween the jaws, will say there is plenty of room in the Newhouse\\r\\nNo. 5 trap, if the trap is properly set. I also see that some\\r\\ntrappers want the swivel in the trap chain 8 or ten inches from the\\r\\nbed piece, or the point of fastening. Now I am somewhat puzzled as to\\r\\nan explanation in this matter, as it seems to me that the swivel will\\r\\nbe far less liable to become useless by being twisted or wound around\\r\\nsaplings, etc., where the swivel is close to the bed piece than it\\r\\nwould be if placed eight or ten inches out in the chain. I prefer to\\r\\nhave the swivel in my trap chain placed as close to the trap as\\r\\npossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS STEEL TRAPS.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that I have but little use for is a trap from which the\\r\\nanimal must take the bait in order to spring it, for often the animal\\r\\nwill go up close enough to a trap to inspect the bait but will not\\r\\ntouch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think that there should be a latch on any trap, as I think\\r\\nthat often the animal\\'s foot is thrown free from the trap, or at\\r\\nleast causes many catches by the tips of the toes and the animal\\r\\nescapes, becoming a hard animal to catch thereafter. The animal\\r\\nhaving a part of the foot resting on the latch and the toes striking\\r\\nthe treadle sufficient to unlatch the treadle, the released jaw will\\r\\nthrow the latch with the portion of the animal\\'s foot resting on the\\r\\nlatch, free from the trap, or at least may often cause a slight catch\\r\\nof the toes or other part of the foot. All that is necessary is to\\r\\nleave an extension to the arm or heel of the treadle to catch over\\r\\nthe jaw of the trap. The trap may be made to spring hard or easy by\\r\\nsimply raising the pan slightly higher or lowering it to catch\\r\\nfarther on to the jaw of the trap more or less as desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow boys, I have given a few of my ideas as to traps, and if any of\\r\\nyou have any suggestions to make as to improvements on the animal\\r\\nsteel traps, let us hear from you through the columns of the H-T-T. I\\r\\nbelieve that manufacturers of animal or game traps would be glad to\\r\\nmake any improvements on their traps could they be convinced that the\\r\\nsuggested improvements were really of any value.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I get many letters from trappers who are beginners in the business\\r\\nmaking inquiries about camping and the necessary traps, guns, etc., I\\r\\nwill try to give a few practical hints to those who have had but\\r\\nlimited experience of trapper\\'s life. While, like the setting of a\\r\\ntrap, there is no single code of rules that will answer for all\\r\\nlocalities and conditions, I will give a few general rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trapper should first try and inform himself of the nature and\\r\\nconditions of the locality where he intends to trap. If the waters\\r\\nare of such a size that a boat can be used to advantage, then the\\r\\nboat becomes a necessity. Now in regard to traps. If the section\\r\\nwhere you intend to trap has the larger animals like bear, otter,\\r\\nbeaver, etc., then the trapper should provide himself with a\\r\\nsufficient number of traps of different sizes as he may be able to\\r\\ntend and do it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would advise to start with, that the trapper has about one-half\\r\\ndozen No. 5 bear traps, one dozen No. 4 wolf and about the same of\\r\\nNo. 3. But the greater number of traps will be Numbers 1 1/2 and 2,\\r\\nif of the Jump or Blake & Lamb pattern. If of other patterns would\\r\\nsay use the Hawley & Norton Nos. 1 1/2 and 2, say 75 No. 1 1/2 and 25\\r\\nNo. 2. The genuine Newhouse is of course the best long spring trap\\r\\nmade, but a little more expensive, and we find that the H. & N. fills\\r\\nthe bill. We prefer the B. & L. on account of its lightness and\\r\\nconvenience in setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if the trapper is trapping where the animals are no larger than\\r\\nfox, raccoon, wildcat, etc., then I want no traps larger than the No.\\r\\n2 1/2, nor smaller than the No. 1 1/2 Blake & Lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about the gun. If you are in a large game country it is quite\\r\\nnecessary that you carry a good rifle. I like the Winchester and not\\r\\nof too large a caliber, but if there is no large game in the locality\\r\\nthen I think one should have a Stevens pistol, ten-inch barrel, or a\\r\\nStevens Pocket Shotgun, 15-inch barrel, and in either case have a\\r\\ngood holster to carry it in. As for myself I prefer a Pocket Shotgun.\\r\\nIt might be well to have a large shotgun in camp. You will also want\\r\\nyour belt axe or hatchet and a good heavy sharp axe at the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for bedding, this will largely depend on what kind of a cabin or\\r\\ncamp you have. If you are in a tent, two persons should have not less\\r\\nthan six good blankets. If your camp is so situated that you can\\r\\ndrive to it with a team or pack horses, then you should have a straw\\r\\nmattress. But if you are in a locality where you can get cedar or\\r\\nhemlock boughs, you should use only the finer boughs. Begin at the\\r\\nfoot of the berth and push the larger or butt end of the bough into\\r\\nthe ground and then begin the next row so as to lap or shingle onto\\r\\nthe first row, and so on until the head of the berth is reached.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you use a tent, I find that it is a good idea to make a skeleton\\r\\nframe of good heavy poles over the tent and about twelve inches above\\r\\nand around the tent and shingle it well with boughs, so that the snow\\r\\nwill not fall directly on the tent. It will be a great help in\\r\\nkeeping out the cold. But I think it is best to have at least one\\r\\ngood log cabin well chinked, mudded and banked. Always select a spot\\r\\nwhere it is easy to drain away the surface water on all sides of the\\r\\ncamp, and if possible have the main camp close to good pure water\\r\\nwhich is a great protection against malaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are doing a stroke of business so that you will need more than\\r\\none camp, the others need not be quite so tidy as the main camp, for\\r\\nit is not likely that you will occupy them more than a night or two\\r\\nat a time. Your temporary camps need not be larger than 6 x 8 and\\r\\nquite low, as this will save both fuel and bedding. Do not forget to\\r\\nget up a good supply of wood at all the camps before the trapping\\r\\nseason is open, for you will find plenty to do after the trapping\\r\\nseason opens without cutting wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main camp should be at least 10 x 12 feet inside. A place should\\r\\nbe provided for curing furs outside. Furs should never be cured by a\\r\\nfire or in a warm place, for this will have a tendency to curl the\\r\\nends of the fur and give it a woolly appearance. There can usually be\\r\\na place fixed either on the outer gable or under the eaves of the\\r\\ncabin to cure the furs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as to the commissary part. You will, of course, to a great\\r\\nextent select the kind and quantity according to the distance and\\r\\nconvenience in getting the grub to camp. The camper will find that\\r\\nthe most convenient as well as better satisfaction, as a rule, will\\r\\nbe found in taking provisions to camp in a crude state, i.e., wheat\\r\\nflour, corn meal, beans, bacon, with the necessary supply of tea,\\r\\ncoffee, sugar, good baking powder, salt, pepper and a quantity of\\r\\nrice. If, as I have before stated, the camp is so located as to be of\\r\\neasy access by wagon, then choose a bill-of-fare to your own liking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medicine box should contain a box of good cathartic pills and a\\r\\nquantity of 2-grain quinine tablets, with any other medicine you may\\r\\nwish. Other necessities about the camp are a good supply of strong\\r\\ncord, a few feet of small rope, a yard or two of muslin, a yard of\\r\\noilcloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be well to give a few suggestions about a temporary camp for a\\r\\nnight, if by chance you should get caught out and unable to reach\\r\\ncamp. You should select a place before dark. If a large fallen tree\\r\\ncan be found that lies close to the ground where you wish to build\\r\\nthe fire it is best. If the log cannot be readily found then select a\\r\\nbank or knoll to build the fire against. First, build the fire out\\r\\nfrom the log five or six feet where you will make your bed so as to\\r\\nwarm the ground. Now set two crotches about four feet high and place\\r\\na pole in these crotches. Then from this pole place three or four\\r\\npoles, one end on the ground, the other resting on the pole that\\r\\nrests in the crotches. Then place boughs, bark, or anything to break\\r\\nthe wind. This shelter will, of course, be placed over the spot where\\r\\nyou will make your bed. Now rake the coals and live embers down\\r\\nagainst the log where you will have the fire for the night. Now place\\r\\nsome boughs over the spot where the fire has been and where your bed\\r\\nwill be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this kind of a camp you can get along through a rather chilly\\r\\nnight. You should always carry matches wrapped in waxed paper in\\r\\nthree or four different places about your person. You may lose your\\r\\nmatch safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf convenient, when going into camp, you should take several\\r\\nstretching boards for different kinds of fur with you. If not, you\\r\\ncan usually find a tree that will split good and you can split some\\r\\nout. It is usually hard to find withes that are long and straight\\r\\nenough to bend so as to form a good shaped stretcher. You should\\r\\nalways aim to stretch and cure the furs you catch in the best manner.\\r\\nIn skinning you should rip the animal straight from one heel across\\r\\nto the other and close to the roots of the tail on the under side.\\r\\nWork the skin loose around the bone at the base until you can grasp\\r\\nthe bone of the tail with the first two fingers of the right hand\\r\\nwhile you place the bone between the first two fingers of the left\\r\\nhand. Then by pulling you will draw the entire bone from the tail\\r\\nwhich you should always do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes when the animal has been dead some time the bone will not\\r\\nreadily draw from the tail. In this case you should cut a stick the\\r\\nsize of your finger about eight inches long. Cut it away in the\\r\\ncenter until it will readily bend so that the two ends will come\\r\\ntogether. Then cut a notch in each part of the stick just large\\r\\nenough to let the bone of the tail in and squeeze it out. It is\\r\\nnecessary to whittle one side of the stick at the notch so as to form\\r\\na square shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should have about three sizes of stretching boards for mink and\\r\\nfox. For mink they should be from 4 1/2 inches down to 3 inches and\\r\\nfor fox from 6 1/4 inches down to 5 inches wide, and in length the\\r\\nfox boards may be four feet and the mink boards three feet long. The\\r\\nboards should taper slightly down to within 8 inches of the end for\\r\\nfox and then rounded up to a point. The mink boards should be rounded\\r\\nat 4 or 5 inches from this point. You will vary the shape of the\\r\\nboard in proportion to the width. Stretching boards should not be\\r\\nmore than 3/8 inch thick. A belly strip the length, or nearly the\\r\\nlength, of the boards 1 1/4 inches at the wide end, tapering to a\\r\\npoint at the other end and about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Have the\\r\\nboards smooth and even on the edges. Other stretching boards should\\r\\nbe made in proportion to the size and shape of the animal whose skin\\r\\nis to be stretched.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should not fail to remove all the fat and flesh from the skin\\r\\nimmediately after the skin is on the board. If a skin is quite wet\\r\\nwhen taken from the animal it should be drawn lightly on the board\\r\\nuntil the fur is quite dry. Then turn the skin flesh side out and\\r\\nstretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is always best if you can go into the country where you intend to\\r\\ntrap. This is especially important if the ground is a new field to\\r\\nyou. During the summer or early fall, acquaint yourself with the\\r\\nstreams and the general surroundings, and prepare some of your best\\r\\nsets for the mink and the fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a dog of good intelligence take him along, though he may\\r\\nnot be broken to the business of trapping. It is many a fox and coon\\r\\nthat my dog has saved for me when they have escaped from footing or a\\r\\nbroken chain. If the dog is of much intelligence, and you use care in\\r\\ntraining him, you will soon find that a dog will learn more about\\r\\ntrapping than you supposed possible. If you have long lines of traps\\r\\nyour dog will inform you more than once that you have passed a trap\\r\\nthat chanced to be a little off the main line.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother bear trappers, how do you like this style of bear trap (see\\r\\nfrontispiece) for toting through the woods three or four miles from\\r\\ncamp and at the same time tote a couple of sheep heads or the head of\\r\\na beef for bait? In times gone by I have carried two or three\\r\\nNewhouse bear traps and bait to bait them with from one to five miles\\r\\nin the woods to pinch old Bruin\\'s toes. Such is a pleasure to any red\\r\\nblooded man, who was born a real lover of the open and the\\r\\nstimulating effect of obtaining that $30 or $40, which the hide and\\r\\nmeat of the bear brought, had on the trapper, was nearly equal to the\\r\\ndesire to be out in the tall timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow brother bear trappers, these traps that you see on my shoulder\\r\\nare of my own make and are made with a half circle bed piece instead\\r\\nof a straight bed piece, as the ordinary trap is made. I wish to call\\r\\nyour attention to how this trap fits the shoulders and how much\\r\\neasier it is to carry than the trap with the straight bed piece and\\r\\nnote how much more readily you can get your gun into shape for\\r\\naction. Many a deer has given me the slip before I could drop the\\r\\nbear traps and get my gun ready for action when I have been toting\\r\\nbear traps in the woods. But with this style of trap your gun can be\\r\\nput in operation at once, regardless of the traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoys, another thing that I have learned in the last five years\\'\\r\\nexperience in trapping in the south, (this was written Spring of\\r\\n1913) is that it requires a trap a size larger to trap small fur\\r\\nbearers in the south than it does in the north, owing to the\\r\\ndifference in conditions of the streams and the soil. Well friend\\r\\nBachelder, there is no use of you and I talking or worrying any more\\r\\nover our bear traps or bear trapping. The gentleman sportsman and his\\r\\ndog has ordered you and I and all other trappers of Pennsylvania for\\r\\nthat matter to cast our traps on to the scrap pile and we must\\r\\nsubmit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamps and Camping.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say that the conditions and location in which one is to camp\\r\\nmakes a great difference in the preparations. If one is just going\\r\\noutside of town to camp for a few days outing, commodities may be to\\r\\nyour liking as to quality and quantity. In these days, should the\\r\\nlarder run low, it is only necessary for the camper to step out a\\r\\nshort distance to a farm house where he is almost sure to find a\\r\\ntelephone. In such cases all that the camper has to do is to \\'phone\\r\\nto town, ordering his favorite brands delivered to camp, and soon an\\r\\nautomobile is on the road laden with supplies, hastening to the\\r\\ncampers\\' relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nConditions are different when the camper is far from town; or perhaps\\r\\nmiles from a dwelling or perhaps even a public road and the camper is\\r\\ncompelled to pack his camp outfit, grub stake and all over miles of\\r\\nrough trail, or it may be no trail at all; then the camper must\\r\\ncurtail his desires to their utmost limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the camper is on strange ground, and the camp is to be permanent\\r\\nor for some weeks, it is best for the camper not to be in too big a\\r\\nhurry to select the camping ground, and take up with any sort of a\\r\\nplace. It is even better to make a temporary camp and look the\\r\\nlocality over and select a place where good water can be had, and\\r\\nwood for fuel is plentiful and near camp. If possible, select a spot\\r\\nin a thicket of evergreen timber of a second growth and out of the\\r\\nway of any large trees that might blow onto the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the ground is sloping, place your camp parallel with the slope,\\r\\nwhether tent or log cabin, as the surface water can more readily be\\r\\ndrained off, and not allowed to soak into the ground and cause\\r\\ndampness inside of the tent. A ditch should be dug around the tent to\\r\\ndrain all surface water, and eaves so the water will not soak inside.\\r\\nIf a log cabin, the dirt from the drain can be thrown up against the\\r\\nlogs of the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the camper expects to camp through cold and snowy weather, it will\\r\\npay him to place a ridge pole in crotches placed firmly in the\\r\\nground. The pole should be a foot above the ridge of the tent, then\\r\\nplace poles from the ground, the ends resting on this ridge pole as\\r\\nrafters to a building, then nail a few poles to these rafters\\r\\nsufficient to keep boughs from dropping down onto the tent. The\\r\\nboughs should be of an evergreen variety. This outer covering should\\r\\nbe well thatched or covered with these boughs. This extra covering\\r\\nadds greatly to the warmth and comfort of the camp, as it protects\\r\\nfrom the wind blowing directly on the tent, also keeps the snow from\\r\\nfalling onto the tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also a great convenience if this ridge pole is allowed to\\r\\nextend out three or four feet, and a strip of canvas run over the\\r\\npole and down to side poles, so as to form a sort of an awning so one\\r\\ncan step outside to wash when it is raining without getting wet. It\\r\\nalso makes a convenient place to pile a small amount of wood, and\\r\\nwill be found useful in many ways such as hanging furs, clothing,\\r\\netc., out to air.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not make your bed on the ground. Build a box bedstead by driving\\r\\nfour posts into the ground, then nail pieces across, up about twelve\\r\\ninches from the ground. Lay small poles on these cross pieces, then\\r\\nnail one or two small poles entirely around on the posts above the\\r\\nbottom pieces forming a sort of crib. This crib may be filled first\\r\\nwith boughs, then on top of the boughs put a quantity of leaves or\\r\\ngrass, when the mattress is lacking. There will also be store room\\r\\nunder the bed, which would be wasted if the bed is made on the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother camper, when you are going well back into the tall timber\\r\\nwhere you are obliged to pack your outfit over a rough trail or\\r\\nperhaps no trail at all, do not waste any energy packing canned \"air\"\\r\\nin the shape of canned fruits. Take your grub in a crude state in the\\r\\nway of flour, beans, lard, bacon or pork, and if fruit is taken, take\\r\\nit in a dried form. Take the necessary supply of tea, coffee, sugar,\\r\\nsalt and pepper, also that unavoidable baking powder.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK FISHING ON PINE CREEK.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to preparing an emergency camp for a night, if the weather is\\r\\ncold, and there is snow on the ground, the camper should pick a place\\r\\nwhere he will be as much sheltered from the cold winds as\\r\\ncircumstances will allow and where he can get wood as conveniently as\\r\\npossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelect a log (if one can be had) that lays close to the ground. Now,\\r\\nscrape away the snow about six or eight feet back from this log, and\\r\\nwhere you will have your bed, build a fire, on this space the first\\r\\nthing you do. Then build a cover over this space or fire, by first\\r\\nsetting two crotched stakes about four feet apart and five or six\\r\\nfeet high, back three feet from the log. Cut a pole, and place it in\\r\\nthese crotches and then from this pole lay poles long enough to come\\r\\nback so as to give room for your bed, covering the space where the\\r\\nfire is built; one end of the poles resting on the ground. With\\r\\nevergreen boughs, cover this entire framework, top and two\\r\\nsides--toward the log open.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow scrape the fire down against the log and proceed to build your\\r\\nfire for the night. Cover the space where the fire was with fine\\r\\nboughs; this is your bed. Take off your coat, and spread it over your\\r\\nshoulders, rather than wear it on you as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the camper has plenty of time, and a good axe, in building an\\r\\nopen campfire the thing to do is to cut two logs six or eight inches\\r\\nin diameter and three feet long and place them at right angles with\\r\\nthe back log, and three or four feet apart; then lay the wood across\\r\\nthese logs. This will give a draft underneath the wood and cause the\\r\\nfire to burn much better than where the wood lays close to the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeer Hunt Turned Into a Bear Hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nA friend by the name of Dingman invited me to come to his camp on\\r\\nMore\\'s Run, a tributary of the Sinnamahoning. This was something like\\r\\nforty years ago, when deer were plentiful and several men in this\\r\\nsection made it a business to hunt for the money that there was in\\r\\nit, and Nathan Dingman was one of those men. It was about eight miles\\r\\nfrom my place to Mr. Dingman\\'s camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning after we had a fall of snow, I packed my knapsack with as\\r\\nmuch grub stake as I was able to carry, with my gun and blanket, and\\r\\nstarted over the hill to Mr. Dingman\\'s camp. After I had crossed the\\r\\ndivide, I did not go far before I began to see deer tracks. There was\\r\\nno road or trail down the run, and the run was pretty well filled\\r\\nwith timber. I had about all that I could handle without deer tracks,\\r\\nbut when I was within about a mile of Mr. Dingman\\'s camp, I came onto\\r\\nthe trail of several deer that had only been gone a few minutes. I\\r\\ncould not stand it longer, so I hung my pack and blanket up in a tree\\r\\nand took my track back up the stream until I was quite sure that I\\r\\nwas well out of range of the deer, and then climbed the ridge until I\\r\\nwas near the top of the hill and on advantageous ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction of the trail of the deer where it crossed the stream\\r\\nled me to think that the deer were going south, or down the ridge but\\r\\non the contrary they had turned to the right and up the ridge. I had\\r\\nnot gone far along the ridge before I began a sharp lookout. I\\r\\nsuddenly found the deer lying in a thicket of low laurel. They broke\\r\\nfrom cover at a breakneck speed. I fired both barrels at them with\\r\\nthe best aim that I was able to get, and had the satisfaction of\\r\\nseeing one of the deer, a good sized doe, stumble and partly fall,\\r\\nthen hobble on in the direction that the other had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly sundown and I only followed the trail a short distance\\r\\nwhen I could plainly see that the deer had a foreleg broken, and she\\r\\nsoon left the trail of the others, and went down the hill all alone.\\r\\nKnowing that the wounded deer would soon lay down if not disturbed. I\\r\\nleft the trail, went back, got my pack, blanket and went on down the\\r\\ncreek to Mr. Dingman\\'s camp. I found Mr. Dingman about to sit down to\\r\\na supper of roast potatoes, venison and other good things to be found\\r\\nin abundance in the woods in those days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we were out at daybreak after the wounded doe. Mr.\\r\\nDingman said that when the doe was started up that she would come to\\r\\nwater, and that she would stop on the creek below where I had left\\r\\nthe trail, which led down the hill until in sight of the creek, when\\r\\nit turned to the right, then went back up the hill only a few yards\\r\\nto the right of her trail where she had gone down.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I saw what the doe had done, I thought to myself, old lady, you\\r\\nare well onto the game, and we will have lots of sport before we get\\r\\nyou. I was well aware that she had seen me when I passed by on her\\r\\ntrail where she had gone down the hill, and thinking that she would\\r\\ngo to the creek below where Mr. Dingman was and told him the game the\\r\\ndoe was playing. He said that she would come to water at the point\\r\\njust below the camp, and that he would go down there and watch, while\\r\\nI should follow the track through. I told Mr. Dingman that I was\\r\\nafraid that we were too late, and that the doe had already gone out,\\r\\nthat she had made her bed so that she could watch her trail where she\\r\\nwent down the hill, and had slipped out after I had gone down the\\r\\nhill on her trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dingman thought that he could get the runway before she would get\\r\\nthrough, even if she had gone out when I came through on her trail\\r\\ndown the hill. In hopes that the deer had not taken the trail and lit\\r\\nout when I came through the hill, I worked my way cautiously back up\\r\\nthe hill, only occasionally going in sight of the trail so as to keep\\r\\nher course, but as I feared, when I was about halfway up the hill, I\\r\\nfound her bed, but the doe was gone. I took the trail and followed it\\r\\nup the hill until she struck the trail of the deer that she was with\\r\\nwhen I first started them, and instead of going down the ridge, she\\r\\ntook the back trail of the other deer. I followed it back until near\\r\\nwhere I had wounded her, when she again broke down the hill and\\r\\ncrossed the creek near where I first found their trail, and had gone\\r\\nback onto the same ridge that she had come from.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the only thing for me to do was to leave the trail and go after\\r\\nMr. Dingman again. When I found him and we got back to camp, it was\\r\\nabout noon, so we got a warm dinner before continuing the chase. When\\r\\nwe got up to where I had left the trail, we held council and made our\\r\\nplans for the next move, and decided that as the old lady was\\r\\ncontinually doing the unexpected, we would follow her track, one\\r\\ngoing on each side of the trail a few yards from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had only gone a short distance up the hill when we found the old\\r\\nlady\\'s bed, where she had laid down, so that she could watch back on\\r\\nher trail, where she had come down on the opposite hillside. We did\\r\\nnot go far when the trail turned to the left and went up the side of\\r\\nthe ridge toward the head of the creek. We continued along the trail\\r\\none on either side and soon we came to where a large hemlock tree had\\r\\nfallen parallel with the side of the hill. Mr. Dingman was on the\\r\\nupper side and above the fallen tree, while the deer tracks led away\\r\\nbelow the tree. All of a sudden I heard the report of Mr. Dingman\\'s\\r\\nrifle, so I stood still for a minute, and hearing nothing more I went\\r\\nto see the cause of the shooting. The doe had gone beyond the fallen\\r\\ntree, then turned back and went about midway of the tree, on the\\r\\nupper side and lay down. Mr. Dingman caught a glimpse of the old lady\\r\\nas she went out, but did not catch her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not follow the doe far from where she lay behind the fallen\\r\\ntree, for we crossed the trail of a bear going west, and partly in\\r\\nthe direction of that of the wounded deer, which continued to work\\r\\nher cards on us all afternoon without our getting sight of her. At\\r\\ndusk we trailed her into a small thicket at the edge of the farm\\r\\nowned by a man by the name of Foster, at the extreme head of the run.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was too late in the day to do any more with the old doe, we\\r\\nconcluded to go to Mr. Foster\\'s and stay over night, and take the\\r\\ntrail early in the morning. It was snowing a little and we thought\\r\\nthat the thicket would be an easy place to find our game, should it\\r\\nsnow enough to cover the tracks. In the morning when we got up, we\\r\\nfound six or eight inches of snow on the ground, that had fallen\\r\\nduring the night. We had an early breakfast, and started out to again\\r\\nplay the game with the broken legged doe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we got to the edge of the woods, we struck the trail of some\\r\\nanimal, that had gone across the field in the early part of the night\\r\\nbefore it had snowed much. We were not positive what sort of an\\r\\nanimal it was, whether man or beast. The trail was leading straight\\r\\nacross the field without a curve in it, and was making straight to a\\r\\nlaurel patch that was one and a half miles away on the Taggart farm,\\r\\nless than a mile below Coudersport.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dingman said that it was a bear. I admitted that it was a bear\\r\\nall right, but replied that I would say it was making for the\\r\\nAdirondack Mountains in New York, rather than the laurel patch on the\\r\\nTaggert farm. We did not have far to go to make sure, and a good part\\r\\nof the distance was across farms, so we concluded to hunt bear a\\r\\nwhile, and give the old doe a rest for a short time. As Mr. Dingman\\r\\nsaid, the bear made straight for the laurel patch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was not more than 15 or 20 acres in the patch, so we thought\\r\\nthat we would circle it and make sure that the bear was still in the\\r\\nlaurel. We found that the bear was there all right, so Mr. Dingman\\r\\nselected a place where he thought the bear would come out when he was\\r\\nrouted from his nest, while I was to follow the trail and drive out\\r\\nthe bear. I followed until near the center of the patch, when I came\\r\\nonto a small open place forty or fifty feet square. This open space\\r\\nwas covered with a heavy growth of wild grass which partly held the\\r\\nsnow from getting close to the ground, and I could see the trail of\\r\\nthe bear through this grass and loose snow very plain until nearly\\r\\nthe opposite side of the open space, and there I could see a bunch of\\r\\nsnow. I was sure that it was the bear that made the bunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought the matter over for a minute, then concluded to back out\\r\\nand go after Mr. Dingman, and see what he thought would be best in\\r\\norder to make a sure thing of Bruin\\'s capture. Mr. Dingman thought\\r\\nthe best thing to do was to go up town and get plenty of help so as\\r\\nto thoroughly surround the laurel, and make sure of Bruin. I\\r\\nobjected, as I thought it best to try our own luck, and if we failed\\r\\nwe could still get plenty of help. We followed my track back to where\\r\\nI had turned, and concluded to both fire at the bunch at the same\\r\\ntime, hit or miss as luck would have it. When we fired at the bunch\\r\\nthere was a shaking of snow, and bruin rolled out but was unable to\\r\\nrise to his feet. On examination we found that one ball had entered\\r\\nhis shoulder. It was a short job to get bruin out to the road, and\\r\\ntake him up to town where we sold him to Mr. Stebbins, a merchant,\\r\\nand then we made tracks back to see if we could find the broken\\r\\nlegged doe. We found by circling the thicket that she was there, and\\r\\nwe had the good luck to get her. We drove her out, and thus ended one\\r\\nof the liveliest day\\'s sport that we ever had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nDog on the Trap Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we will say first that there is as much or more difference in\\r\\nthe man who handles the dog as there is in the different breeds of\\r\\ndogs. I have heard men say that they wanted no dog on the trap line\\r\\nwith them, and that they didn\\'t believe that any one who did want a\\r\\ndog on the trap line knew but very little about trapping at best.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow those are the views and ideas of some trappers, while my\\r\\nexperience has led me to see altogether different. One who is so\\r\\nconstituted that they must give a dog the growl or perhaps a kick\\r\\nevery time they come in reach, will undoubtedly find a dog of but\\r\\nlittle use on the trap line. I have known some dogs to refuse to eat,\\r\\nand would lay out where they could watch the direction in which their\\r\\nmaster had gone and piteously howl for hours. I have seen other dogs\\r\\nthat would take for the barn or any other place to get out of the way\\r\\nof the first sight or sound of their master. This man\\'s dog is\\r\\nusually more attached to a stranger than to his master. The man who\\r\\ncannot treat his dog as a friend and companion will have good cause\\r\\nto say that a dog is a nuisance on the trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen men training dogs for bird hunting, who would beat the\\r\\ndog most cruelly and claim that a dog could not be trained to work a\\r\\nbird successfully under any other treatment. Though I have seen\\r\\nothers train the same breed of dogs to work a bird to perfection and\\r\\ntheir most harsh treatment that they would use would be a tap or two\\r\\nwith a little switch. I will say that one who cannot understand the\\r\\nwag of a dog\\'s tail, the wistful gaze of the eyes, the quick lifting\\r\\nof the ears, the cautious raising of a foot, and above all, treat his\\r\\ndog as a friend, need not expect his dog to be but little else than a\\r\\nnuisance on the trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years ago I had a partner who had a dog--part stag hound and\\r\\nthe other part just dog, I think. One day he, my partner, asked if I\\r\\nwould object to his bringing the dog to camp, saying that his wife\\r\\nwas going on a visit and he had no place to leave the dog. I told him\\r\\nthat if he had a good dog I would be glad to have the dog in camp. In\\r\\na day or two pard went home and brought in the dog. Well, when he\\r\\ncame, the dog was following along behind his master with tail and\\r\\nears drooping, and looking as though he had never heard a kind word\\r\\nin his life. I asked if the dog was any good and he replied that he\\r\\ndid not know how good he was. I asked the name of the dog. He said,\\r\\n\"Oh, I call him Pont.\" I spoke to the dog, calling him by name. The\\r\\ndog looked at me wistfully, wagging his tail. The look that dog gave\\r\\nme said as plain as words that that was the first kind word he had\\r\\never heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went inside and the dog started to follow, when his master in a\\r\\nharsh voice said \"get out of here.\" I said, \"Where do you expect the\\r\\ndog to go?\" I then took an old coat that was in the camp, placed it\\r\\nin a corner and called gently to Pont, patted the coat and told Pont\\r\\nto lay down on the coat which the dog did. I patted the dog, saying,\\r\\n\"that is a good place for Pont,\" and I can see that wistful gaze that\\r\\ndog gave me now. After we had our supper I asked my partner if he\\r\\nwasn\\'t going to fix Pont some supper. \"Oh, after awhile I will see if\\r\\nI can find something for him.\" I took a biscuit from the table,\\r\\nspread some butter on it, called the dog to me, broke the biscuit in\\r\\npieces and gave it to the dog from my hand, then I found an old basin\\r\\nthat chanced to be about the camp and fixed the dog a good supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the dog had finished his supper I went to the coat in the\\r\\ncorner, spoke gently to Pont, patted the coat and told Pont to lay\\r\\ndown on the coat. That was the end of that, Pont knew his place and\\r\\ntook it without further trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when we were about ready to start out on the trap\\r\\nline I asked pard what he intended to do with Pont. He said that he\\r\\nwould tie him to a tree that stood against the shanty close to the\\r\\ndoor. We were going to take different lines of traps. I said, \"What\\r\\nis the harm of Pont going with me?\" \"All right, if you want him but I\\r\\ndon\\'t want any dog with me.\" I said, \"Am (that was pard\\'s given name,\\r\\nfor short), I do not believe that dog wants to go with you any more\\r\\nthan you want him.\" Am\\'s reply was that he guessed he would go all\\r\\nright if he wanted him. I said, \"Am, just for shucks, say nothing to\\r\\nthe dog and see which one he will follow.\" So we stepped outside the\\r\\nshack and the dog stood close to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, \"Go on Am, and we will see who the dog will follow.\" He\\r\\nstarted off and the dog only looked at him. Am stopped and told the\\r\\ndog to come on. The dog got around behind me. A said, \"If I wanted\\r\\nyou to come you would come or I would break your neck.\" I said, \"No,\\r\\nAm, you won\\'t break Pont\\'s neck when I am around, it would not look\\r\\nnice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI started on my way, Pont following after I had gone a little ways. I\\r\\nspoke to Pont, patted him on the head and told him what a good dog he\\r\\nwas. He jumped about and showed more ways than one how pleased he\\r\\nwas. He showed plainly the disgust he had for his master.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so happened that the first trap that I came to was a trap set in a\\r\\nspring run, and it had a coon in it. I allowed Pont to help kill the\\r\\ncoon, and after the coon was dead I patted Pont and told him what\\r\\ngreat things we had done in capturing the coon, and Pont showed what\\r\\npride he took in the hunt, so much so that he did not like to have Am\\r\\ngo near the pelt. I saw from the very first day out that all Pont\\r\\nneeded was kind treatment and proper training to make a good help on\\r\\nthe trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was careful to let him know what I was doing when setting a trap,\\r\\nand when he would go to smell at the bait after a trap had been set,\\r\\nI would speak to him in a firm voice and let him know that I did not\\r\\napprove of what he was doing. When making blind sets, I took the same\\r\\npains to show and give him to understand what I was doing. I would\\r\\nsometimes, after giving him fair warning, let him put his foot into a\\r\\ntrap. I would scold him in a moderate manner and release him. Then\\r\\nall the time when I was resetting the trap I would talk trap to him,\\r\\nand by action and word, teach him the nature of the trap. Mr.\\r\\nTrapper, please do not persuade yourself to believe that the\\r\\nintelligent dog cannot understand if you go about it right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two weeks Pont had advanced so far in his training that I no\\r\\nlonger had to pay any attention to him on account of the traps and\\r\\nthe third day that Pont was with me he found a coon that had escaped\\r\\nwith a trap nearly two weeks before. My route called me up a little\\r\\ndraw from the main stream, and I had not gone far up this when Pont\\r\\ntook the trail of some animal and began working it up the side of a\\r\\nhill. I stood and watched him until the trail took him to an old log,\\r\\nwhen Pont began to snuff at a hole in the log, and he soon raised his\\r\\nhead and gave a long howl, as much as to say \"he is here and I want\\r\\nhelp.\" After running a stick in the hole I soon discovered that the\\r\\nlog was hollow. I took my belt axe and pounded along on the log until\\r\\nI thought I was at the right point and then chopped a hole in the\\r\\nlog. As good luck would have it, I made the opening right on the\\r\\ncoon, and almost the first thing I saw on looking into the log was\\r\\nthe trap. Pont soon had the coon out, and when I saw that it was the\\r\\ncoon that had escaped with our trap, I gave Pont praise for what he\\r\\nhad done, petting him and telling him of his good deed, and he seemed\\r\\nto understand it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after this Am came into camp at night and reported that a\\r\\nfox had broken the chain on a certain trap and gone off with the\\r\\ntrap, saying that he would take Pont in the morning and see if he\\r\\ncould find the fox. In the morning when we were ready to go Am tried\\r\\nto have Pont follow him but it was no go, Pont would not go with him.\\r\\nThen Am put a rope onto him and tried to lead him but Pont would sulk\\r\\nand would not be led. Then Am lost his temper and wanted to break\\r\\nPont\\'s neck again. I said that I did not like to have Pont abused and\\r\\nthat I would go along with him. When we came to the place where the\\r\\nfox had escaped with the trap Am at once began to slap his hands and\\r\\nhiss Pont on. Pont only crouched behind me for protection. I\\r\\npersuaded Am to go on down the run and look at the traps down that\\r\\nway while Pont and I would look after the escaped fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Am was gone I began to look about where the fox had been\\r\\ncaught and search for his trail, and soon Pont began to wag his tail.\\r\\nI began to work Pont\\'s way and said, \"has he gone that way?\" Pont\\r\\ngave me to understand that the fox had gone that way and that he knew\\r\\nwhat was wanted. The trail soon left the main hollow and took up a\\r\\nlittle draw. A little way up this we found where the fox had been\\r\\nfast in some bushes but had freed himself and he had left and gone up\\r\\nthe hillside. Pont soon began to get uneasy, and when I said, \"hunt\\r\\nhim out,\" away he went, and in a few minutes I heard Pont give a long\\r\\nhowl and I knew that he had holed his game. When I came up to Pont he\\r\\nwas working at a hole in some shell rocks. I pulled away some loose\\r\\nrocks and could see the fox, and we soon had him out and Pont seemed\\r\\nmore pleased over the hunt than I was. There was scarcely a week that\\r\\nPont did not help us out on the trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot infrequently did Pont show me a coon den. I had some difficulty\\r\\nin teaching Pont to let the porcupines alone, but after a time he\\r\\nlearned that they were not the kind of game that we wanted, and he\\r\\npaid no more attention to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had many different dogs on the trap line with me. I can say\\r\\nthat to any one who can understand \"dog\\'s language,\" has a liking for\\r\\na dog and has a reasonable amount of patience and is willing to use\\r\\nit, will find a well trained dog of much benefit on the trap line,\\r\\nand often a more genial companion than some partners. But if one is\\r\\nso constituted that he must give his dog a growl or a kick every time\\r\\nhe comes in reach, and perhaps only give his dog half enough to eat\\r\\nand cannot treat a dog as his friend, then I say, leave the dog off\\r\\nthe trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS OLD TRAPPING DOG PRINCE.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Cases of Buck Fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have heard many hunters say that they had never had a case of buck\\r\\nfever, and that they could shoot at a deer with as little emotion\\r\\nunder all circumstances as they could at a target. Now this is not\\r\\nthe case with me, for the conditions under which I am working makes\\r\\nall the difference imaginable with my nervous system. I never saw but\\r\\none place that I did not get the buck fever when deer hunting and\\r\\nthat was in Trinity and Humboldt counties, California. There I saw\\r\\ndeer so thick and tame that it was no more exciting than it would be\\r\\nto go into a drove of sheep in a pasture and shoot sheep. If by\\r\\nchance you failed to hit the deer the first shot it was only a matter\\r\\nof a few minutes when you would have another opportunity to kill your\\r\\ndeer. So there was no cause to get the fever, but such has not been\\r\\nthe case in Eastern States, for many years at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1880, a man by the name of Corwin and I were camping on the\\r\\nJersey Shore turnpike in Pennsylvania. We had just gone into camp and\\r\\nas I usually make it a point to first get plenty of wood cut for the\\r\\ncamp at night, so that when I come home in the evening I will not\\r\\nhave to go out and cut wood, I had been cutting wood and fixing up\\r\\nall day until four o\\'clock in the afternoon, when I suggested to Mr.\\r\\nCorwin that we go out and see if we could find some signs and locate\\r\\nthe deer so that we would know where to look for them early the next\\r\\nmorning. We followed down a ridge for some distance without seeing\\r\\nany signs of deer but about the time that it was getting dark so that\\r\\nwe could not see very good and we were about to go to camp, we came\\r\\nonto a trail of a number of deer. As it was so dark we left the trail\\r\\nand went to camp being careful not to start or alarm the deer. The\\r\\nnext morning when we got up we found that a snow had fallen of some 8\\r\\nor 10 inches and knowing that this snow would cover the trail of the\\r\\ndeer so deep that there would be no following it until we could start\\r\\nthem out of their beds, we concluded that one of us should go down\\r\\nthe ridge opposite or west of the ridge where we had found the trail\\r\\nof the deer. It was decided that I should take the ridge opposite\\r\\nwhere the deer were thought to be, and Mr. Corwin was to warn me by\\r\\nfiring two shots in rapid succession if he started the deer without\\r\\ngetting a shot at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was familiar with the woods and knew about where the deer would run\\r\\nwhen started up from any particular point. I had gone down the ridge\\r\\nuntil I thought that I was below the point where the deer would have\\r\\ncrossed had they done so during the night, or if Mr. Corwin should\\r\\nstart them. I had neither heard anything from Mr. Corwin nor seen\\r\\nanything of the deer trail. I had given up hope of Mr. Corwin\\r\\nstarting the deer so they would be likely to come my way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had struck the trail of a single deer that was going down a short\\r\\nsawtooth point or a short spur of the main ridge. The track had been\\r\\nmade during the night when it was still snowing and in some places it\\r\\nwas hard to follow the trail owing to so much snow falling. The track\\r\\nled down this spur in the direction of low hemlocks. I was working my\\r\\nway very carefully thinking that the deer had gone down into those\\r\\nlow hemlocks to get shelter from the storm and were lying down in the\\r\\nthicket. The thicket was just over a little cone or ridge so that I\\r\\ncould not see the surface of the ground and I was dead sure that I\\r\\nwould catch my game lying in his bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment a dozen deer came into sight as suddenly as though they\\r\\nhad come up out of the ground and I was suddenly taken with one of\\r\\nthe worst fevers that any man ever had. I at once began firing into\\r\\nthe bunch. The deer seemingly did not notice the report of the gun\\r\\nbut kept steadily on their trail. I knew the condition I was in and\\r\\nthat I was shooting wide of the mark. I then singled out one of the\\r\\nlargest deer, a good sized buck, and tried to pick out a spot on the\\r\\nback of his shoulders as though I was shooting at a target. I could\\r\\nnot keep the gun within range of the deer by ten feet, so when I\\r\\nthought the gun had jumped into line, I pulled the trigger. The deer\\r\\nmade no alteration in its course or speed but kept steadily bounding\\r\\nalong. The deer were not more than forty yards from me. I dropped on\\r\\none knee and leaned the gun across my knee, grabbed a handful of snow\\r\\nand jammed it into my face, then placed the gun to my face and began\\r\\nfiring at the deer again with no better results.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the bunch of deer were nearly a hundred yards away and they had\\r\\nall passed over the brow of the hill, except one large doe that was a\\r\\nlittle behind the rest, the fever left me as suddenly as it came on.\\r\\nI pulled the gun onto her and fired. She staggered, gave a lunge down\\r\\nthe hill and fell dead. I could have told within an inch of where the\\r\\nball struck her before I went to the deer. I could not have told\\r\\nwithin fifty feet of where my other shots went.\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed my drove of deer a short distance to make sure that I had\\r\\nnot wounded any of them and then I dragged the doe down into the\\r\\nhollow to dress and hang up. Pretty soon Mr. Corwin came to me and\\r\\nseeing only the one deer asked me if that was the only one I had\\r\\nkilled with all that shooting. Mr. Corwin said that he had counted\\r\\nnine shots that I had fired. When I told him the story he had a\\r\\nhearty laugh of half an hour and said that I was lucky that I did not\\r\\ndie in a fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow boys, you who have never had the buck fever can laugh at me all\\r\\nyou like, but those who are over fond of the chase and get the buck\\r\\nfever will sympathize with me. Had I been expecting and looking for\\r\\nthis drove of deer at the time instead of only one deer I should not\\r\\nhave been attacked with this case of buck fever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I will tell you of another case of buck fever from a cause\\r\\nentirely different from that just related. I was following the trail\\r\\nand there was just enough snow on the ground to make the best of\\r\\nstill hunting. The wind was blowing just strong enough to make a\\r\\nnoise in the tree tops overhead to drown any noise that the hunter\\r\\nmight make by stepping on a dry limb, and every once in a while there\\r\\nwould come a snow squall that would be so dense that you could see\\r\\nscarcely fifty feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had trailed the doe along the side of the hill for some distance.\\r\\nShe was feeding alone and I was working along very carefully, keeping\\r\\nalong the ridge several yards above the trail, to always be on\\r\\nadvantage ground. I had not seen the trail of any other deer during\\r\\nthe morning although it was in the height of the mating season, or as\\r\\nus common folks call it, the running season. I was trailing the doe\\r\\nalong through a small basin where the timber was nearly all hardwood,\\r\\nbeech and maple, and the woods were very open. I was quite positive\\r\\nthat the doe was not far in advance for she had just been feeding on\\r\\nsome moss from a limb that had blown down from a tree and the tracks\\r\\nwere very fresh. About this time one of those snow squalls had come\\r\\nup. I was standing by a large maple tree waiting for the squall to\\r\\npass by so that I could look the ground over well before I went any\\r\\nfarther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the squall had passed I looked the ground over closely but\\r\\ncould see nothing of my deer. Forty or fifty yards farther along the\\r\\nside of the hill and below me there was a very large maple tree which\\r\\nhad turned up by the roots. This tree hid from view a piece of ground\\r\\nclose to the log. I could see that the trail led directly up to the\\r\\ntree. I could see a slight break in the snow on top of the log that I\\r\\ntook to be made by the leg of the deer in jumping the log. I could\\r\\nsee nothing of the trail beyond the tree so I worked very cautiously\\r\\nalong until I could see past the root of the tree and as I suspected,\\r\\nthere stood my game with head down, apparently asleep and standing\\r\\nbroadside to me. I drew the gun onto a point just back of her\\r\\nshoulders and let go and the deer dropped almost in her tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cut the deer\\'s throat and began to skin out the foreparts. I had\\r\\nonly partly gotten my work done when another one of those snow\\r\\nsqualls came along. I was bending over the deer, busy at work when I\\r\\nheard a slight noise, and straightened up to see what had caused it.\\r\\nI looked none too soon to save myself from a terrible thrust from the\\r\\nhorns of a large buck deer, for as I straightened up the deer shot\\r\\npast me like a shot from a gun, barely missing me and landed some six\\r\\nor eight feet beyond me. I had stood my gun against the log 8 or 10\\r\\nfeet from me. I sprang for my gun but I was trembling so that I could\\r\\ndo nothing and I could scarcely stand on my feet. The buck stood for\\r\\na moment looking back over his shoulders. Every hair on his back\\r\\nstood up like the hair on the back of an angry dog and I well\\r\\nremember the color of his eyes which were as green as grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deer stood and gazed at me for a moment then slowly walked off.\\r\\nThe deer had gone some distance before I could control myself\\r\\nsufficiently to shoot. The buck had followed the trail of the doe up\\r\\nto the fallen tree and had caught me skinning her and it angered him.\\r\\nInstead of running off he was determined to attack me and the only\\r\\nthing that saved me from being severely hurt was my straightening up\\r\\njust at the right time to miss the thrust of the buck and the deer\\'s\\r\\nmissing me was what caused him to leave me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the worst case of buck fever that I have ever had and I do\\r\\nnot care to ever experience a case of that kind again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartner a Necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I promised to give some reasons why a partner is necessary, and as\\r\\nI have trapped many seasons both with and without a partner, I should\\r\\nknow something about the subject. A writer, some time ago, in\\r\\nHunter-Trader-Trapper said that it took some trappers fifty years to learn\\r\\nwhat others learned in a week. Now, I fully agree with this writer,\\r\\nfor it only took me about three seconds to learn that a partner was\\r\\nnecessary, and it came about in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had several bear traps set near what is known as the Hogsback on\\r\\nthe old Jersey Turnpike Road in Pennsylvania. The traps were strung\\r\\nalong the ridge that divides the waters of the East Fork and the West\\r\\nFork, which are tributaries of the west branch of the Susquehanna\\r\\nRiver and were setting from one and a half miles to four miles of the\\r\\nwagon road, and about nine miles from any house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time in question was the last days of October or the first of\\r\\nNovember, and the day a very warm one for that time of the year. I\\r\\nhad been walking very fast, in fact where the ground was favorable, I\\r\\nwould take a dog trot. I wished to make the rounds of the traps and\\r\\nget out of the woods that day. When I came to where the second trap\\r\\nhad been set, I found it gone, clog and all. The place where the trap\\r\\nwas setting was in the head of a small ravine and near the edge of a\\r\\nwindfall, just on the lower side of the bait pen, and but a few feet\\r\\nfrom it lay the partly decayed trunk of a large tree. I jumped on to\\r\\nthis tree to get a good look down into the windfall to see if bruin\\r\\nwas anywhere in sight. I had scarcely got on the log when I received\\r\\na reception which I think was something equal to that the Russian\\r\\nNaval Fleet met with in the Corean Straits. I had jumped square into\\r\\na colony of large black hornets, and they did punish me terribly in\\r\\nthree minutes\\' time. My feet were swollen so that I was obliged to\\r\\nremove my shoes and my entire body was spotted as a leopard with\\r\\ngreat purple blotches and the internal fever which I had was most\\r\\nterrible. I thought that every breath that I drew was my last. I was\\r\\ntwo miles from the wagon road and nine or ten miles in the\\r\\nwilderness. No one knew where I was, nor where the traps were set.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought no more of the bear. I only thought of reaching the wagon\\r\\nroad. I began one of the worst battles of my life, but after a\\r\\nstruggle of three hours I got to the road more dead than alive. But\\r\\nhere fortune favored me for soon after a man by the name of White\\r\\n(one of the county commissioners who had been in the southern part of\\r\\nthe county on business) came along. He took me home where the doctor\\r\\nsoon got me on my feet again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told my oldest brother where he would find the trap, so he took a\\r\\nman and team and went early the next morning and got the bear all\\r\\nright. It was four or five days before I felt able again to go into\\r\\nthe woods and look at the traps, but when I did, I found a small\\r\\nbear, (a cub) dead and the skin nearly worthless. This was 45 years\\r\\nago, but I am still working at the same old trade, in a small way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another time and previous to the time mentioned, I, with a\\r\\npartner, was trapping on the headwaters of Pine Creek. We had been in\\r\\ncamp about a week, when one day we had been setting a line of traps\\r\\nabout three miles from camp. It was in November and the weather was\\r\\nvery disagreeable, yet we were hustling for we knew that the snow\\r\\nwould soon be on us, and then we wished to put in all the time we\\r\\ncould hunting deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day in question Orlando (that was my partner\\'s name) long\\r\\nbefore noon was complaining of a bad headache, and said that it\\r\\nseemed as though every bone in his body ached. I tried to persuade\\r\\nhim to go to camp but he insisted on setting more traps. About three\\r\\no\\'clock in the afternoon he was obliged to give up, and said he would\\r\\nsit down where he was and wait until I could go further up the stream\\r\\nand set a couple more traps. I said no, we will go to camp, so we\\r\\nstarted. We were about three miles from camp, but Orlando could only\\r\\ngo a few steps when he would be obliged to rest. He soon became so\\r\\nweak that I could only get him along by partly carrying him. He was\\r\\nseveral years younger than I, but he was somewhat heavier, so he was\\r\\nrather more of a load than I could well manage.\\r\\n\\r\\nI kept tugging away with him, and about 9 o\\'clock in the evening I\\r\\ngot him to camp, where I fixed him as comfortable as I could, then I\\r\\nbegan a race of about eleven miles to Orlando\\'s father\\'s house. The\\r\\ndistance was about one-half of the way through the woods and it took\\r\\nme until 12 o\\'clock to make it, but we soon had a team hitched to the\\r\\nwagon and were on the way back to the camp where we arrived about 3\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning. We could only get within about one and a\\r\\nfourth miles of the camp with a wagon, so we had to leave it there\\r\\nand go on with only the horses. When we got to the camp we found\\r\\nOrlando no better, so we got him on to one of the horses and by\\r\\nsteadying him the best we could, managed to work our way back home.\\r\\nWe arrived there about 8 o\\'clock in the morning and found a doctor\\r\\nalready waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make a long story short, it is sufficient to say that Pard had a\\r\\nlong run of typhoid fever, and if he had been in the woods alone he\\r\\nwould have surely died. I could relate other incidents where a pard\\r\\ndid come in very acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is a necessity to have a partner, it is also necessary to have\\r\\na good one, for the successful trapper has no idler\\'s job on his\\r\\nhands. You should always have a partner who is able to read and write\\r\\nand should have a pencil and paper in your pocket, for it often\\r\\nhappens that you wish to leave a message at a certain place where\\r\\nPard and you expect to meet on the trap line. Then each one takes a\\r\\ndifferent line of traps, and circumstances has happened since you\\r\\nleft camp in the morning that it changes the entire program. It also\\r\\noften happens that you get into camp at a different time than what\\r\\nyou expected and wish to go out again and take up another line of\\r\\ntraps, and you should try to keep one another informed as to about\\r\\nwhat section you are working in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways endeavor to carry out the plans as near as possible the way\\r\\nthey were planned before leaving camp in the morning. Of all things,\\r\\ndo not accept of a man who is lazy or void of manly principles as a\\r\\npartner, for sooner or later you will drop him. Then it will make no\\r\\ndifference how much you have done for him or how much you have\\r\\nbefriended him in times past, he will do you all the dirt he is\\r\\ncapable of doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to know all about a man, go camping with him. Probably\\r\\nyou think you know him already, but if you have never camped on the\\r\\ntrail with him, you do not. It may be that he is your near neighbor\\r\\nor he may have been a partner in business, but if you have not camped\\r\\nwith him, you have yet to learn him. It is not a hard job to believe\\r\\na man a good fellow when at home, but when you have camped with him\\r\\non the trail, then you will know him. When your companion wishes to\\r\\nannoy any game, which you may find in your traps for the mere purpose\\r\\nof hearing the animal moan with pain; will shoot birds and animals\\r\\njust for the purpose of killing if you have a team with you, and your\\r\\ncompanion will ride up the steep hills where other men would walk;\\r\\nwill neglect his beasts of burden in any way, this man you should\\r\\nnever choose as your camping or trapping partner. But when you find\\r\\none who will never wantonly torture a dumb animal and is kind to his\\r\\nbeasts of burden, always giving it all the advantages and kind\\r\\ntreatment possible, this man you needn\\'t fear to accept as a trapping\\r\\npartner for in this man you will find \"a friend indeed when in need.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Few Words on Deadfalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, as I have been asked to give my idea on the deadfall as a\\r\\npractical trap in taking the fur bearing animals, will say that I do\\r\\nnot consider it a useless contrivance as some of the boys of the trap\\r\\nline claim. On the contrary, I consider it to be a very successful\\r\\ntrap in taking many of the fur bearers such as will readily take bait\\r\\nincluding the skunk, mink, coon, opossum, rabbit, muskrat, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not to be supposed that the fox, coyote, wolf, etc., can be\\r\\ntaken in the deadfall; neither is it supposed to be as convenient or\\r\\nas successful a trap as the steel trap. Yet, under favorable\\r\\nconditions I prefer it to the steel trap in trapping some animals,\\r\\nand it is certainly a little more humane in its operation as it\\r\\nusually kills its prey almost instantly, therefore it saves the\\r\\nanimal much suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there are many kinds of deadfalls, the most of which have been\\r\\nshown from time to time in Hunter-Trader-Trapper. Were I up on\\r\\ndrawing, I would illustrate some of the deadfalls which I consider\\r\\nthe most successful, but I am not, so enclose photo. I will mention\\r\\nsome of the deadfalls which I have seen in use in different parts of\\r\\nthe country, some of which were good, but the majority I have seen in\\r\\ngeneral use I did not like mostly on account of the length of time\\r\\nthat it took to construct them, and the manner in which it was\\r\\nnecessary to place the bait.\\r\\n\\r\\nI prefer a deadfall so constructed that several different kinds of\\r\\nbait can be used at the same time, therefore the trap is ready for\\r\\nmore than one kind of an animal and also a trap that is readily\\r\\nconstructed. In the South we see many deadfalls. The most common\\r\\ndeadfalls used are those made by placing a bottom log about six or\\r\\neight inches in diameter and five or six feet long. The drop was\\r\\nabout the same size as the bottom log, only much longer and stakes\\r\\nwere split from the pine logs and driven into the ground the entire\\r\\nlength of the bottom log on both sides of the log. These stakes or\\r\\nboards were long enough to come above the drop log when the trap was\\r\\nset. The drop log was placed between the two rows of stakes and above\\r\\nthe bottom log. The common figure 4 trigger was used and placed about\\r\\nmidway of the bottom log and raising the drop log six or eight inches\\r\\nfrom the bottom log. This made a runway that enabled the animal to\\r\\nenter from either end of the run and the animal necessarily was on\\r\\ntop of the bottom log and directly under the drop log. The bait was\\r\\nfastened to the spindle. This deadfall may work well on mink, skunk\\r\\nand opossum, but I hardly think it a good trap for other animals and\\r\\nit requires too much time to construct it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: GOOD SMALL ANIMAL DEADFALL.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother deadfall that I saw in common use on the Pacific Coast as\\r\\nwell as in other sections of the country was the ordinary string\\r\\ndeadfall. It is hardly necessary to describe this trap for every boy\\r\\nwho works a trap line knows how to make them. The trap is made by\\r\\nusing a bottom log three or four feet long and a drop log of the same\\r\\nsize, but much longer. If the trap is not heavy enough of its own\\r\\nweight, place logs on the drop log until it is sufficiently heavy to\\r\\nkill the animal. Four stakes are driven, two on either side of the\\r\\nlog and close to the bottom log and about two feet apart and driven\\r\\nso that the top or drop log will work easily between the stakes. Two\\r\\nof the stakes, the ones driven on the side where the bait pen is, had\\r\\na crotch or fork and a stick was placed in these crotches. A string\\r\\nwas tied to the drop log and to a stick of the proper length so that\\r\\nwhen the drop log was raised up eight or ten inches from the bottom\\r\\nlog and the string passed over the stick in the crotches, one end of\\r\\nthe trigger stick would rest against the stick placed in the\\r\\ncrotches. The other end would slightly catch onto another stick, laid\\r\\ndirectly under the one that rests in the crotches and resting against\\r\\nthe forked stakes and about two inches from the bottom log. This\\r\\nstick is called the treadle, as the animal going into the bait pen to\\r\\nget the bait must step on this treadle, pushing it down, which will\\r\\nrelease the trigger spindle and allow the drop log to fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bait pen is usually made by driving stakes in a circle from one\\r\\nof the trap stakes to the other stake on the same side of the bottom\\r\\nlog. This style of a deadfall is alright as to handling bait, but I\\r\\ndo not consider it a sure trap, as often the animal will set off the\\r\\ntrap before it is far enough under the drop to make a sure catch. I\\r\\nprefer a trigger that will cause the animal to get at least one fore\\r\\nleg over the bottom piece before the trap is sprung.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn making this style of a deadfall it is not necessary to use a\\r\\nstring and the forked stakes with the cross stick in the forks; all\\r\\nthat is necessary is to have two upright standards, one locked on to\\r\\nthe other by just a notch cut in the standard that the drop rest on\\r\\nand catch the other end of the standard resting on the bed place.\\r\\nThis standard is made slightly wedge shape so as to rest firmly in\\r\\nthe notch in the upper standard. The notch should be about two-thirds\\r\\nthe distance from the lower end of the stick up and just long enough\\r\\nto come down and rest against the side of the crossbar or treadle,\\r\\nwhich, as before stated, should be about two inches above the bed\\r\\npiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stone deadfall with the figure 4 trigger, I have found in common\\r\\nuse in nearly all sections where large flat rocks were to be had to\\r\\nuse in making the trap. This stone deadfall is alright in mink\\r\\ntrapping and smaller animals but it is not favored much in coon\\r\\ntrapping. There are many other styles of deadfalls which I will try\\r\\nto describe later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to animals taking bait, will say, I have never had much trouble in\\r\\ngetting meat or carnivorous animals to take bait, but sometimes it is\\r\\nnecessary to use a different bait than what they will take at other\\r\\ntimes. This, undoubtedly, is owing to what the animals have been\\r\\naccustomed to feeding on. If the animal is fed on a certain kind of\\r\\nfood and will no longer take readily to it as a bait, then use\\r\\nsomething different. For instance, I found it difficult on the\\r\\nPacific Coast in the vicinity of Vancouver to get mink to take flesh\\r\\nas a bait, while they readily took other baits. When the mink will\\r\\nnot take bait readily, then of course the deadfall does not make a\\r\\nsuccessful mink trap. While the deadfall cannot take the place of the\\r\\nsteel trap, yet a well constructed deadfall under some conditions has\\r\\nadvantages over the steel trap. Often a deadfall can be set in a\\r\\nthicket of evergreen trees or under a single pine, hemlock or other\\r\\nevergreen tree, or it may be protected by building a frame of poles\\r\\nabove the trap and cover with boughs to partly protect the trap from\\r\\nthe heavy snows. Now you have a trap that will work alright, where a\\r\\nsteel trap would freeze down from sleet or other causes and would not\\r\\nspring; nor will Johnny Graball carry off a deadfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, boys, do not shun the deadfall when trapping skunk in a section\\r\\nwhere material is convenient to build it with, and especially if you\\r\\nare near your trapping grounds so that you can go out at times and\\r\\nput up a trap or two so as to have a good line of deadfalls ready\\r\\nwhen the trapping season arrives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvice from a Veteran.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn trapping, cultivate the habit of taking great care in making sets.\\r\\nAlways leave the surface level. As you cannot tell what particular\\r\\nanimal may come your way, prepare for the most cunning. Note the\\r\\nsurroundings of your set and use such material for covering as may be\\r\\nfound there so that all may appear natural. Never stake the traps\\r\\ndown for a dry land set, but select for a drag an old limb or root;\\r\\nnot one fresh cut if avoidable. Obliterate your tracks; John Sneakem\\r\\nwill not then catch on so quick. Above all things, never molest\\r\\nanother\\'s traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jump-trap as now made by the Oneida Community has thicker jaws\\r\\nthan the old style and therefore it is not so liable to foot the\\r\\nanimal. I find it a good trap to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor mink, a good set is close to a bank and near the edge of the\\r\\nwater. The bait if any is used, should be fresh muskrat, rabbit or\\r\\nchicken. All are good. If you wish for scent, the musk from the\\r\\nanimal you are trapping is preferable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne famous trapper says, \"any fool knows enough to catch a muskrat.\"\\r\\nI doubt whether this man himself, knows how to trap them\\r\\nsuccessfully. Of course, everyone knows that muskrats should be\\r\\ntrapped along streams or swails where you find their works. For bait\\r\\nuse carrots, cabbage or sweet apples. I like sweet apples best, and\\r\\nso do the muskrats. Set the trap in about two inches of water, fasten\\r\\nthe chain at full length to a sunken limb, drive a stake on either\\r\\nside of the chain near where it is fastened and you need not fear\\r\\nthat the rat will \"foot\" himself. He will soon become entangled and\\r\\ndrown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother good set for rats is by scooping a piece out of a sod and\\r\\nplacing it on a stone or root just under the water. Set trap on sod,\\r\\nfasten the chain as before and scatter bits of apple on the sod.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, boys, as many of you are about to seek new trapping locations,\\r\\nand as I have had more or less experience in trapping from the\\r\\nAtlantic to the Pacific, and as I get many letters from brother\\r\\ntrappers as to different trapping locations, I thought perhaps that\\r\\nit would not come amiss to give you a little of my experience in\\r\\nregard to this matter. I would advise that before you go to a new\\r\\nlocation in other states from those in which you are familiar with\\r\\nthe game laws, that you first write to the State Game Commissioner of\\r\\nthe state that you intend to trap in, enclosing 10 or 15 cents in\\r\\nstamps, and ask for a copy of the game laws, or for the information\\r\\nthat you desire. The address of the Game Commissioner is usually at\\r\\nthe capital of the different states. Advice on game laws is generally\\r\\nso meager that it is often misleading, and one relying on newspaper\\r\\ninformation, often runs up against problems that he would not have\\r\\nundertaken had he known the exact truth of the matter. The game laws\\r\\nof the different states are changed so often that the only way to get\\r\\nreliable information is to go direct to headquarters. Now, some\\r\\nstates have local laws, county laws, and some states have even\\r\\ntownship laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will also speak of writing to trappers for information as to the\\r\\nquantity of the fur bearing animals and game in their locality as\\r\\nanother way to get posted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while I hope that the average trapper is as truthful as mankind\\r\\ngenerally, I am aware that a trapper will sometimes exaggerate as to\\r\\nthe amount of game in his locality. If the person whom you make the\\r\\ninquiry of, is not particularly interested in trapping, or knows but\\r\\nlittle about trapping and wild life, he is liable to think there is\\r\\nmuch more game in his county than there really is. And on the other\\r\\nhand, if the party makes a business of trapping, he is quite liable\\r\\nto think that game is less plentiful than it really is. It is a good\\r\\nplan to write to two or more parties in the same neighborhood, on\\r\\nthis matter, if you can, and then draw your own conclusion as to the\\r\\nscarcity or plentifulness of the game in that section. But the better\\r\\nway is to go and prospect the country and acquaint yourself with the\\r\\nlocality, for you remember the old adage, \"If you would have your\\r\\nbusiness done, go and attend to it yourself; if not, send some one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read with interest the discussion of the many different makes\\r\\nof guns, the different calibers for large game hunting, etc., and as\\r\\nI am not well up on \"gunology,\" I have listened and wondered why\\r\\nthere was so much agitation on the gun question. I believe that\\r\\nnearly all of the modern guns that are manufactured today are\\r\\ngood--at least sufficiently good shooters for all practical purposes.\\r\\nShotguns can be bought at $3.00 or $4.00 that do good work. Perhaps\\r\\nthere is not a man in the country who has carried a gun as many days\\r\\nas the writer, but what has done more target shooting than I have.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in the 70\\'s when men hunted deer in this section for the money\\r\\nthat was in it, I often did not take my rifle down to shoot from one\\r\\nseason\\'s hunting to the next, unless by chance something in the way\\r\\nof game came into fields near the house. I was always in love with my\\r\\ngun and if I did not like it I would get rid of it at the first\\r\\nopportunity. I am still of the opinion that a gun is similar to a\\r\\nman\\'s wife, you must love them in order to get the best results.\\r\\n\\r\\nI always wanted as good a gun as there was on the market. By this I\\r\\ndo not mean the highest priced, nor the highest power gun, but the\\r\\ngun that would do the business. A man by the name of Orlando Reese\\r\\nand I were the first to buy Winchester rifles in this section, and I\\r\\nthink in this county. The guns were the common round barrel .44\\r\\ncaliber and we paid $60.00 apiece for them. The same kind of a gun\\r\\ncan now, I think, be bought for $12.00 or $14.00. Previous to the\\r\\ntime I bought the Winchester, I had been using a Henry rifle for a\\r\\ntime, but it was not a good gun for hunting purposes. A few years\\r\\nlater the .45-75 Winchester came into use, so I sold my .44 and\\r\\nbought a .45-75. I did not like it so I sold it and bought a Colts,\\r\\nwhich was a good gun, but one day I was doing some fast work on a\\r\\nbunch of deer and in my haste I did not work the lever just as I\\r\\nshould and it jammed. This made me rather angry, so I sold it and got\\r\\nanother .44 Winchester, which I used for a long time, but I disposed\\r\\nof it very unexpectedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was coming out from camp after a new stock of provisions. My\\r\\npartner, Amersley Ball, was with me. We had not gone far after\\r\\ngetting in the wagon road when we met a man by the name of Lyman who\\r\\nwas on his way to the Cross Fork of Kettle Creek, for the purpose of\\r\\ninspecting the timber lands and wanted a gun to carry with him.\\r\\nBefore Mr. Lyman was hardly in speaking distance he yelled at me and\\r\\nasked what I would take for my gun. Thinking that he was only joking\\r\\nI said $40.00.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Lyman came up to me, took my gun from my shoulders, looked at it\\r\\nand asked me if it was alright. I replied that if it was not I would\\r\\nnot be carrying it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Lyman replied, \"I guess that is right,\" and taking a check from\\r\\nhis pocket dropped down on one knee, filled it out for forty dollars\\r\\nand handed it to me, so I was without a gun right in the midst of the\\r\\nhunting season.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy protest was of no use, as Mr. Lyman took the gun and went his way,\\r\\nlaughing at me. I received a little more for the gun than the usual\\r\\nprice at the time, but there was no dealer at our place who kept the\\r\\nWinchester in stock. The dealers were always obliging and would take\\r\\nyour order and get you a gun for a small profit of about sixteen\\r\\ndollars. I had no time to wait for a gun to be ordered, so I began to\\r\\nlook about to find some one who had a gun for sale. Mr. Wm. Thompson,\\r\\nthe publisher of a local newspaper in our place had bought a new .38\\r\\ncaliber Winchester to use in his annual outing and said that he would\\r\\nhave no further use for a gun until another season that if I would\\r\\ngive him $35.00, I could have his gun. I gave Mr. Thompson the money\\r\\nand the next morning we went back to camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had arrived at camp, I crossed the divide from the\\r\\nSinnemahoning side of the Pine Creek side to hunt. I had not gone far\\r\\nafter reaching Pine Creek before I struck the trail of five or six\\r\\ndeer. After following the trail a ways I concluded that the deer\\r\\nwould pass around the point of the ridge and pass through a hardwood\\r\\nbalsam on the other side of the ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI climbed the hill and made for the balsam in hope to head the deer\\r\\noff. I had only reached the brow of the hill so that I could look\\r\\ninto the basin when I saw the deer. I thought to myself, there is a\\r\\ngood chance to try my new gun, for I had not yet shot it. I drew on a\\r\\nlarge doe that was in the lead of the bunch and cut loose. The doe\\r\\nmade a leap into the air, made a jump or two down the hill and went\\r\\ndown, while the rest of the deer made two or three jumps up the hill\\r\\ntowards me and stopped and looked back down the hill in the direction\\r\\nof the doe that I had shot. I pulled onto the shoulders of a buck,\\r\\nthe largest deer of the bunch, who gave his tail a switch or two,\\r\\nwheeled, made a few jumps down the hill and fell, while the rest of\\r\\nthe bunch made a lively break for other parts. I continued to scatter\\r\\nlead as long as I could see them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran down to the deer that I had killed, cut their throats, removed\\r\\ntheir entrails, climbed some saplings, bent them down, cut off the\\r\\ntops and hung the deer on them. Getting a pole with a crotch at the\\r\\nend to place under the sapling, I pulled the deer up the best that I\\r\\ncould and started on the trail of the others. I did not follow the\\r\\ntrail long when I saw one of them had a broken leg. The deer with the\\r\\nbroken leg soon dropped out from the others and went down the hill,\\r\\ncrossed the hollow and went into a thick hemlock timber and laurel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was nearly night, I left the trail and went home to camp. The\\r\\nnext morning, Mr. Ball went with me to help get the wounded deer. We\\r\\ndid not follow the trail far until we saw the deer fixing to lie\\r\\ndown. I backed up and went up the hill above where we thought the\\r\\ndeer might be lying. While Mr. Ball waited for me to give the signal\\r\\nto come. Mr. Ball had not gone far after I had howled, letting him\\r\\nknow that I was ready, when out of the laurel came the deer. Mr. Ball\\r\\nwas close, so that we both got a shot, killing the deer almost before\\r\\nit was on its feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I was so infatuated with my new gun, that it was a case of love\\r\\nat first sight. This was in the late 70\\'s. I have used several\\r\\ndifferent makes of guns. I also had a .30-30 Savage, which I\\r\\nconsidered a good gun for big game, and in fact, I can say that the\\r\\nmost of the guns that I have tried were all good. I however am still\\r\\nmarried to my little .38 Winchester. I can say that in all these,\\r\\nconsiderable more than thirty years, I have never run up against a\\r\\nsubject but that this little Winchester was equal to the emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I wish to ask, why it is that a hunter cares for a high power gun\\r\\nthat will shoot into the next township and kill a man or a horse that\\r\\nthe hunter was not aware of existing, when a gun of less power will\\r\\ndo just as good execution in deer hunting? The ammunition for the gun\\r\\nof lower power costs much less and there is far less danger in\\r\\nkilling a man or beast a mile away. We hear men talk of shooting deer\\r\\n200 and even 300 yards. In the many years that I have hunted deer, I\\r\\nbelieve that I have killed two deer at a distance of from 50 to 75\\r\\nyards, to one a distance of 100 or 150. I believe most deer hunters\\r\\nwill agree that there are far more deer killed at a distance of 50 or\\r\\n60 yards than over that distance. I think that if those hunters who\\r\\nkill deer at a distance of 100 or 200 yards will take the trouble to\\r\\nstep off the distance of their long shots, instead of estimating\\r\\nthem, they will find that 100 yards in timber is a long ways. Yes,\\r\\nboys, 20 rods through the timber is a long ways to shoot a deer. Why?\\r\\nBecause the deer can not often be seen at a greater distance, where\\r\\nthere would be any use of shooting at all, and the little .38 will do\\r\\nall of that and more too.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the average beginner at trapping makes his greatest\\r\\nmistake in listening to those who have had more experience in\\r\\nhandling the pen than the trap. For instance, someone advised readers\\r\\nto use a No. 2 or 3 Newhouse trap to catch marten and said that\\r\\nmarten frequented marshy places. Now if they had asked the editor of\\r\\nHunter-Trader-Trapper, he would have told you that the Pine Marten\\r\\nfrequented the higher and dry grounds in dark, thick woods and that\\r\\nit was their nature to run on old down trees and to run into hollow\\r\\nstubs, trees, etc., and that these were the places to set your traps.\\r\\nUnless you were in a country where the snow fell very deep, then you\\r\\nshould use the shelf set. He would have also told you that the No. 1\\r\\nand 1 1/2 Newhouse trap was plenty strong enough for the marten, that\\r\\nmany use No. 0.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: SPRING SET FOR FOX.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average trapper also makes a mistake in listening to some one\\'s\\r\\nideas about scents in trapping the animal, instead of going to the\\r\\nforest, the field and the stream and there learn its nature, its\\r\\nhabits and ways, and its favorite food. He also makes a mistake by\\r\\nspending his time in looking after scents, rubber gloves to handle\\r\\ntraps with and wooden pincers to handle bait, instead of spending his\\r\\ntime in learning the right way and the right place to set his traps.\\r\\nFor one little slip and the game is gone if the trap is not properly\\r\\nset. It is like hunting in the days of the percussion cap gun. I have\\r\\ntramped all day long over hills and through valleys to get a shot at\\r\\na deer, and just at night get the coveted opportunity, taking every\\r\\nprecaution to see that there was no bush or obstruction in line. I\\r\\nwould take deliberate aim, holding my breath that my aim might be\\r\\nsure. I trick the trigger, flick went the hammer, up goes the deer\\'s\\r\\ntail and away he bounds beckoning me to come on. Come on, and my\\r\\nday\\'s tramp has been in vain all on account of a damp gun cap. Now in\\r\\nthese days of fixed ammunition, such mishaps rarely occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is so in setting the trap, one little misfit and the game is gone.\\r\\nIn the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, I read, undoubtedly written by a\\r\\ntrapper of many years experience, telling the true way of setting the\\r\\ntrap in front of a V shaped pen. He said that the trap should always\\r\\nbe set so that the animal had to pass over the jaws of the trap and\\r\\nnot between them. Now mark my mistakes, for of late years I have been\\r\\nvery particular to set the traps so that the animal passed between\\r\\nthe jaws, not over them for I reasoned like this: I thought that the\\r\\nanimal might step on one of the jaws and turn the trap up without\\r\\nspringing it. In so doing be frightened away, or that the animal\\r\\nmight have ball of foot resting on the jaw of the trap, while it set\\r\\nthe trap off with its toes, or the ball of the foot might rest on the\\r\\nlatch, while the trap was sprung with the toes on the pan. In either\\r\\ncase, the animal\\'s foot would be thrown entirely from the trap or so\\r\\nthat it would only get slightly pinched, which would put a flea into\\r\\nthe animal\\'s ear that he would never forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn days long since past, I was not particular how I set the trap,\\r\\njust so I got it planted, but in those days I also made the mistake\\r\\nof running after scents. We make a mistake in thinking that the fox\\r\\nis more sly in some states than in others.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long ago, I received a letter from a friend in Maine, asking if I\\r\\ndid not think that the fox was harder to trap in some states than\\r\\nothers. Now the states that I have trapped in are rather limited, but\\r\\nI have trapped in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, mostly in\\r\\nPennsylvania. I have also trapped in one or two other states, and\\r\\nwherever I found the fox, I found him the same sly fox. In order to\\r\\ntrap this animal successfully it was necessary to comply with the\\r\\nnatural conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make mistakes in not handling our fur properly; in not removing\\r\\nall fat and flesh from the skin in not stretching the skin on the\\r\\nproper shaped stretchers. Stretchers for most fur that we case should\\r\\nnot taper more than 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch from shoulder to hind legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make mistakes in setting our traps too early, for one prime skin\\r\\nis worth more than three early caught ones. We make mistakes in not\\r\\nhaving one, and only one, responsible and honorable party in each\\r\\nlarge city to ship our furs to; by giving one party a large trade\\r\\nshould give the trapper the full market price for his furs. It would\\r\\nalso have a tendency to make the buyer honest and honorable, even\\r\\nthough he was not built strictly that way in making. All trappers\\r\\nshould know the address of the party agreed upon in each city. This\\r\\nwould give the trapper a chance to ship to the party most convenient\\r\\nto the trapper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst mistake of all mistakes is in one who uses poison to kill\\r\\nwith. Let me tell of an instance that came under my observation the\\r\\nspring of 1900, I believe it was. I had an occasion to go into the\\r\\nsouthern part of this country, my road lay over the divide between\\r\\nthe waters of the Alleghany and Susquehanna, about five miles of the\\r\\nroad lay over a mountain that was thickly wooded and no settlers.\\r\\nWhile crossing this mountain I saw the carcasses of four foxes lying\\r\\nin the road. On making inquiries I learned that a man living in that\\r\\nneighborhood was making a practice each winter of driving over the\\r\\nroads in that section and putting out poisoned meat to kill the\\r\\nfoxes. I chanced to meet this man not long ago. I said, \"Charley,\\r\\nwhat luck did you have trapping last winter.\" His reply was, not much\\r\\nonly got one or two foxes. Old Shaw has dogged them out of the\\r\\ncountry (referring to a man who hunted with dogs). I said, \"Charley,\\r\\ndon\\'t you think that poison business had something to do with it. He\\r\\nreplied, \"Oh, h--l there will be foxes after I am dead.\" This man\\r\\ncalled himself a trapper, and is quite an extensive fur buyer. Thomas\\r\\nPope says, \"Man\\'s inhumanity to man, makes countless thousands\\r\\nmourn.\" But, in this case, I think it is the dumb animal that mourns\\r\\nand not the man. The trapper who makes the greatest mistake of his\\r\\nlife is the one who does not subscribe for the Hunter-Trader-Trapper.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a former article I undertook to give the most practical way of\\r\\nkilling a skunk, as I have found it, but owing to a mistake, it left\\r\\nthe method of killing rather hard to be understood, so I will try\\r\\nagain. I do this, owing to the many requests that I have from\\r\\ntrappers to give a method for killing skunks, without the skunk\\r\\nscenting themselves as well as the trapper. Practically, there is no\\r\\nway of killing a skunk without causing the skunk to discharge his\\r\\nscent. Their scent is a skunk defense, and they will use it when in\\r\\ndanger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow my way of doing the job is to go at it without hesitation. We\\r\\nhave an old adage, \"If you would grasp a nettle, grasp it as a man of\\r\\nmettle.\" Now my plan is to wear clothes on the trap line to be\\r\\ndiscarded as soon as the day\\'s work on the trap line is finished.\\r\\nWhen I come to a trap that has a skunk in it, I approach the skunk,\\r\\nadvancing a single step at a time, with a good strong stick about\\r\\nfour feet long, with the stick drawn up in readiness to strike as\\r\\nsoon as close enough. Now when I am close enough to make the blow\\r\\nsure I strike the skunk a hard blow across the back, and immediately\\r\\nafter, I place my foot on the skunk\\'s back, holding the animal tight\\r\\nto the ground. At the same time giving the skunk a sharp rap or two\\r\\non the head with the stick to make sure that it is dead. Then pick up\\r\\nthe skunk and remove it a little to one side of the place where it\\r\\nwas killed. Rip the skunk across from one leg to the other close to\\r\\nroots of tail, skinning around the scent glands at the roots of tail,\\r\\nso that the glands can be easily cut out and thrown away or saved for\\r\\nbait, as the trapper wishes. Now proceed to skin the skunk. By\\r\\nfollowing these directions, the trapper will not suffer any great\\r\\ninconvenience from the animal\\'s scent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if the trapper is a little timid, he can carry some kind of a gun\\r\\nof small caliber and shoot the skunk in the head. But if the skunk\\r\\ndoes not use his weapon of defense, then it is a different skunk than\\r\\nI have been accustomed to meet with. If the trapper uses a clog\\r\\ninstead of a stake to fasten his trap with, and his traps are close\\r\\nto water, he can use a long pole or a hook and gently drag the skunk\\r\\nto the water and drown it. Then the water will carry the fluid or\\r\\nscent as discharged, away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if the trapper is very timid and has plenty of time, I would\\r\\nadvise that he provide himself with a light pole ten or twelve feet\\r\\nlong, split at one end and take a quart tin can with sockets or\\r\\nbrackets soldered onto the sides of the can, so that the can may be\\r\\nplaced in between the split at the end of the pole. The two prongs\\r\\nplaced into the sockets on the can so as to hold the can firm. Now\\r\\nfill the can part full of cotton and prepare yourself with a bottle\\r\\nof chloroform (not brandy). Now with this outfit the trapper will\\r\\nproceed to follow along his trap line, and when he finds a skunk in\\r\\nhis trap he will cautiously approach the skunk after he, the trapper\\r\\n(not the skunk) has well saturated the cotton in the can from the\\r\\nchloroform from the bottle. Then gently work the can up to the\\r\\nskunk\\'s nose and over its head, when the chloroform will soon do its\\r\\ndeadly work. After the skunk is dead, the trapper should remove the\\r\\nscent glands as before described, lest the scent may be squeezed from\\r\\nthe glands in skinning the skunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reader asks what kind of a gun he shall take with him to hunt\\r\\ndeer, as he is contemplating going on a deer hunting trip next fall.\\r\\nNow I would say any kind of a rifle that suits you. But if you should\\r\\nask me what kind of a gun I use, I would not hesitate to say that I\\r\\nprefer the 38-40 and black powder. This gun shoots plenty strong to\\r\\ndo all the shooting as to distance or penetrations that the deer\\r\\nhunter will require, and there is not near so much danger of shooting\\r\\na man or domestic animal a mile away that the hunter knows nothing\\r\\nof, as is the case with a high power gun. Besides, from an economical\\r\\npoint, the ammunition for the 38-40 black powder gun costs only about\\r\\none-half that of the smokeless or high power guns. However, if the\\r\\nhunter thinks that he must have a high power gun in order to be a\\r\\nsuccessful deer hunter, he will find the 30-30 or similar calibers\\r\\ngood for large game, and it is not heavy to handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Screech of the Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time ago, a writer to the H-T-T, whose name I have forgotten,\\r\\ngave his views in regard to this subject, and requested that the\\r\\nreaders give their experiences and ideas on the matter. A year or so\\r\\nago, I wrote to a sporting magazine (now defunct) giving my views on\\r\\nthis horrible screech of the panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have camped in the wilds of California, Oregon, Idaho and\\r\\nWashington. Sixty years ago, in my childhood days, it was an everyday\\r\\noccurrence to hear some one tell of having a panther follow them\\r\\nthrough a certain piece of woods, and tell of the horrible screams\\r\\nthat the panther gave while following them. And still to this day,\\r\\nthere is, occasionally a person who reports of hearing that terrible\\r\\nscreech of the panther here in old Potter, notwithstanding that there\\r\\nhas not been a panther killed in the county for upwards of fifty\\r\\nyears, though twice within fifty years, I have been frightened nearly\\r\\nout of my boots by that terrible screech.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion I was watching a salt lick for deer; I was on a\\r\\nscaffold built up in a tree thirty or forty feet from the ground. The\\r\\nlick was in a dense hemlock forest. It was well along into the\\r\\nnight--I was listening with all my energy, expecting to hear the tread of a\\r\\ndeer, but, so far I had heard nothing but the rustle of the porcupine\\r\\nand the hop of the deer-mouse and the jump of the rabbit on the dry\\r\\nleaves. Still, I was listening intently for that tread of a deer\\r\\nwhich sounds different from that of any other animal, when, with the\\r\\nsuddenness of a flash of lightning that terrible screech of the\\r\\npanther came within six feet of my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas I frightened? I guess yes. And had not my gun been tied to a limb\\r\\nof the tree to keep it in place it would have gone tumbling down the\\r\\ntree to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlancing up in the direction from whence that terrible scream came, I\\r\\ncould plainly see the outline of a screech owl.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn another occasion I had started about midnight from home to go to\\r\\nmy hunting camp. About five miles of the distance was along a road\\r\\nwith heavy timber on each side. The night was warm for the time of\\r\\nthe year, with a slight mist of rain. I was hustling along the best I\\r\\ncould to reach camp by the time it was daylight. I had my rifle and a\\r\\npack-sack with a grub stake to last for a week, on my back. When\\r\\nagain, with great suddenness that terrible screech of the panther\\r\\nsounded in the trees over my head. The screech was so sudden and so\\r\\nsharp that I came near dropping right through to China. After\\r\\nrecovering my breath and gazing into the timber for a moment, I again\\r\\ndiscovered one of those frightful owls.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery close observer, who has put in a great deal of time in the\\r\\nwoods in the night, away from a fire and noise, knows that an owl\\r\\nwill alight within a few feet of them, and they will not be aware of\\r\\nthe presence of the owl when it approaches them. This noiseless\\r\\nmovement of the owl is said to be from the large amount of down that\\r\\ngrows on the wings of the bird.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stated, I have camped in several states west of the Rockies, and\\r\\nhave from childhood until late years almost continually been in the\\r\\nwoods, and the only screech of the panther I ever heard came from the\\r\\nowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father moved from Washington County, York State, into this county\\r\\nabout a hundred years ago, when northern Pennsylvania was an unbroken\\r\\nwilderness, and the few settlers who lived in these parts were\\r\\ncompelled to go sixty miles to Jersey Shore to mill. This trip was\\r\\nmade down Pine Creek, and usually with an ox team, and those who made\\r\\nthe trip were obliged to camp out every night while making the trip\\r\\nfor there were no settlers living along the whole route. The road was\\r\\nmerely a trail cut through the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather often made this trip down Pine Creek to Jersey Shore, camping\\r\\nout each night. I have often heard him say that he never head any\\r\\nkind of a noise that he thought came from a panther--and panthers\\r\\nwere plentiful in this section in those days. Father laughed at the\\r\\nidea of the panther screaming, when he heard people telling of\\r\\nhearing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, regardless of what my father and other early settlers of\\r\\nthis section, who were not possessed of strong imaginary minds have\\r\\ntold me, as well as my own experience, I have evidence that the\\r\\npanther does scream and scream terribly, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nA neighbor of mine, by the name of Mr. Mike Green, a man about fifty\\r\\nyears old, after reading the article which I mentioned at the\\r\\nbeginning, came to me and said that I was away off in regard to the\\r\\npanther not screaming. He told of two occasions where he had had\\r\\nadventures with panthers and they screamed fearfully. One of Mr.\\r\\nGreen\\'s adventures happened in Clearfield County, this state, the\\r\\nother in West Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Green stated that he was driving a team, hauling supplies for a\\r\\nlumber camp, when on two occasions he was out on the road until late\\r\\nat night with his load of supplies some of which consisted of several\\r\\nquarters of fresh beef. He heard the panther scream out in the woods\\r\\nand narrowly escaped the panther by whipping the team and driving\\r\\nrapidly into camp, the panther following him, screaming at every\\r\\njump.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few nights later the panther again attacked Mr. Green near camp. He\\r\\nheard it scream and again made haste to reach the camp. When near\\r\\ncamp the panther made several attempts to leap onto the wagon, but\\r\\nowing to Mr. Green\\'s rapid driving the panther failed to reach the\\r\\nload.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Mr. Green was lumbering in West Virginia. The teamster who was\\r\\nhauling camp supplies the same as Mr. Green had in Clearfield County,\\r\\nwas killed by a panther. Mr. Green heard the panther scream and when\\r\\nthe teamster did not come, he with others from the camp went in\\r\\nsearch of the man, and found him dead. The men in camp made up a\\r\\npurse to pay the burial expenses, Mr. Green contributing to the fund.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have often been going along the road at dusk through the woods and\\r\\nhad an owl follow along for some distance, flying from tree to tree,\\r\\nalighting on trees near me, and would often give one of those\\r\\nscreeches, which no doubt has often been mistaken for the scream of a\\r\\npanther, when this trick of the owl occurred when too dark to be\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screech of the panther I believe to be all imagination. Years ago\\r\\nit was an everyday occurrence to hear some one tell of a panther\\r\\nscreaming in a certain locality and tell how it (the panther) had\\r\\nfollowed them and how they escaped by running their horses, and how\\r\\nthe panther screamed in a tree right over their head, and how they\\r\\ncould see the panther\\'s eyes shine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I know that one cannot see an animal\\'s eyes shine unless the\\r\\nanimal is in the dark and a light shines directly in their eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not always these stories are told to misrepresent facts, but it\\r\\nis often the case of imagination or being mistaken. One of the large\\r\\nowls has another cry or call besides the well known hoo-hoo-hoo,\\r\\nwhich the deer still-hunter often imitates when he wishes to inform a\\r\\ncompanion just where he is without fear of alarming the deer. The\\r\\nwriter has often seen, just at twilight, or nearly break of day, one\\r\\nof those large owls follow along some distance in the woods, flying\\r\\nfrom tree to tree, lighting on the lower branches of the trees, only\\r\\na few feet above my head, apparently doing this from curiosity.\\r\\nFrequently the owl would give a screech which was similar to that\\r\\ngiven by a woman who has been suddenly frightened. Undoubtedly this\\r\\nscreech of the owl has often been taken for that of the panther.\\r\\nOwing to the great abundance of down or fine feathers on the quills\\r\\nof the wings of the owl, the owl can light within six feet of a\\r\\nperson\\'s head, and if the owl was not seen, you would not know of its\\r\\npresence, for you could not hear the flight of the owl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I have not had as much experience in the haunts of the panther\\r\\nas some, yet I have been all through the Pacific Coast States and a\\r\\ngood part of the mountains, and have never heard what I thought was\\r\\nthe cry of a panther, or a mountain lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father often told me that he had never heard anything that he\\r\\ncalled a screech of panther and did not think that a panther ever\\r\\nmade any such screeching noise as is claimed, yet in my younger days\\r\\nit was a frequent occurrence to hear some one tell of hearing a\\r\\npanther and how a panther had followed them through a certain piece\\r\\nof woods. Even to this day we occasionally hear of some one being\\r\\nfollowed by a panther and how they had heard a panther screeching on\\r\\na certain hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandling Raw Furs and Other Notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoys, as you are nearly all in from the trap line and the trail,\\r\\n(May, 1910), I am going to take the opportunity to give the younger\\r\\ntrappers (and some of the older ones, too) a drubbing. I would like\\r\\nto see every trapper get all that his furs are worth and I would not\\r\\nlike to see one-half the value of your furs go, simply because you\\r\\nneglected to skin and stretch your catch as it should be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the past winter I was in town one day and met a fur buyer and\\r\\nhe asked me to go over and see his bunch of furs, saying, \"I am going\\r\\nto ship the furs tomorrow.\" I went with the fur dealer and found that\\r\\nhe had a lot of stuff, several hundred dollars worth of furs,\\r\\nconsisting of fox, coon, skunk, mink, and muskrat, some wildcat. A\\r\\ngood part of this bunch of furs had been caught at least a month\\r\\nbefore it should have been. Of this unprime fur I will have but\\r\\nlittle to say. I am sorry to know that any trapper will throw away\\r\\nhis time and money by trapping furs before the fur is in reasonably\\r\\nprime condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dealer had many coon and skunk that had from one-half to a pound\\r\\nof grease left on the skin. I asked the dealer if he was going to\\r\\nship those pelts with all that grease on. His reply was, that he was\\r\\ngoing to ship the furs just as they were and added that he did not\\r\\npay anything for that fat, and only half what the skins were worth if\\r\\nthey had been handled right. I suggested that he would have to pay\\r\\nexpress charges on that grease. The dealer said that he could not\\r\\nhelp that, signifying that he had made that up in buying the furs. I\\r\\ncalled the dealer\\'s attention to a very good black skunk skin, that\\r\\nhad been badly skinned and stretched and asked what he paid for such\\r\\na pelt. He said that he did not remember, but he knew that he did not\\r\\npay $3 for a hide that looked like that. Now this skunk skin was\\r\\nspoiled so far as the looks went, if not in real value, and it at\\r\\nleast gave the dealer a good excuse to put that pelt in the third or\\r\\nfourth grade. The trapper, in skinning this skunk, had ripped down on\\r\\nthe inside of the forelegs and across the belly three or four inches\\r\\nup from the tail. The proper way being to begin at the heel, ripping\\r\\nstraight down the leg and close to the under side of the tail. Then\\r\\ncarefully cut around the roots of the tail and work the skin loose\\r\\nfrom the tail bone until the bone can be taken between the fingers on\\r\\none hand and with the other hand draw the tail bone clear from the\\r\\ntail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this pelt the tail bone had been cut off close to the body and\\r\\nleft in the tail. In stretching this skin the trapper had made a\\r\\nwedge-shaped board. The board was at least four inches wider at the\\r\\nbroad end than it should have been and then sharpened off to a point.\\r\\nI think it best to make the stretching board in width and length in\\r\\nproportion to the animal, slightly tapering the board up to where the\\r\\nneck of the animal joined to the shoulders, then taper and round up\\r\\nthe board to fit the neck and head of the animal. The tapering from\\r\\nthe shoulders to the point of the nose of course would necessarily be\\r\\nlonger on a board for a fox or mink than that of a muskrat or coon,\\r\\nwhich would need to be more rounding. There are some good printed\\r\\npatterns for stretching boards for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have noticed that some trappers have holes in the broad end of\\r\\ntheir stretching boards and hang up their furs while drying with the\\r\\nhead of the animal hanging down. Now I think that is a wrong idea. It\\r\\nis not a natural way for the fur on the animal to lay, pitching\\r\\ntowards the head of the animal, and especially if there is any\\r\\ngrease, blood, or other matter that would dry, causing the fur to\\r\\nstick out like the quills on a fretful porcupine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, boys, let us get into the habit of getting more money out of our\\r\\ncatch of furs by removing the greater part of the fat from the skins;\\r\\nalso by taking a little more time to skin and stretch the furs that\\r\\nwe catch; also by doing less early and late trapping, when the fur is\\r\\nnot in a fairly prime condition. I am pleased to see so many of the\\r\\ntrappers in Pennsylvania advocating a closed season on the furbearers\\r\\nof this state, though I think that they seem to be in favor of a\\r\\nlonger open season than will be to the trapper\\'s advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, are you awake to the conditions under\\r\\nwhich we must work? The dog man has no use for the trapper and his\\r\\ntraps. Now comrades, while I am a lover of the dog, and have used him\\r\\non the trap line and trail, I have, nevertheless used the dog for a\\r\\ndifferent purpose than it is ordinarily used by the average\\r\\nsportsman. I hope the trappers throughout the country will arouse\\r\\nthemselves to the conditions and not allow the legislation of their\\r\\nrespective states to pass laws to put the trapper in the hole, at the\\r\\npleasure of the dog man, as has been done here in Pennsylvania. (This\\r\\nwas written Spring of 1912.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that the dog man and the trapper, are each entitled to\\r\\nequal privileges--the dog has no better friend than the writer.\\r\\nThough we do not blame our brother trapper, who will not put up as\\r\\ngood a scrap in defense of his traps and his sport and occupation, as\\r\\ndoes the dog man in defense of his dog, and his way of enjoying an\\r\\noutdoor life. But comrades, we are all men and sportsmen in our way,\\r\\nand let us be reasonable in this matter; but brother trappers, let us\\r\\nnot take a back seat because we may not be possessed with as large an\\r\\namount of worldly goods as some of the dog men may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpress your views upon this matter of the trappers\\' rights through\\r\\nthe columns of Hunter-Trader-Trapper. Also with our respective\\r\\nrepresentatives that they may not pass game laws that the trapper is\\r\\ncompelled to ignore, as is the case here in Pennsylvania. Here they\\r\\nask for a bounty on noxious animals, yet, the law forbids the setting\\r\\nof a trap in a manner that would take anything more wary or greater\\r\\nthan the weasel. Was this law enacted wholly for the benefit and\\r\\npleasure of the dog man?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I wish to speak of another matter that I think is greatly to the\\r\\ninterest of the trapper, and that is, early and late trapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, no, I do not mean morning and evening--I refer to trapping early\\r\\nand late in the season. And while I do not approve of putting out\\r\\ntraps too early in the season, it is far better that we begin\\r\\ntrapping in October, than it is to continue trapping until into\\r\\nMarch, for such animals as mink, fox and skunk begin to fade, or\\r\\nbecome rubbed, while the mink that is caught in October, has nearly\\r\\nits full amount of fur. Still, the flesh side of the skin is a little\\r\\ndark, which gives the dealer a chance to quote the skins as unprime,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the pelt has its full value as to fur purpose. And as\\r\\nto furs caught in March, the dealer has a chance to quote \"springy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd brother trappers of the States, do not put off your shipments of\\r\\nfurs until late in March. It has been my experience where furs are\\r\\nshipped late in the spring, the returns are marked \"springy,\"\\r\\n\"rubbed,\" etc., notwithstanding the skins, or at least part of them,\\r\\nmay have been caught in December or January.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, let us work for our own interest, for no one will do it for\\r\\nus. And, Comrades, you are certainly aware that the dog man is\\r\\nplaying every card to put the trapper in the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line and trail, I wish to ask your ideas as to\\r\\nwhether it is advisable to stick to the taking of the fur and game\\r\\nlate and early, all the year around. We know that we all like the\\r\\nsport, and the trapper is a little greedy, as well as people of other\\r\\noccupations. But, is it wise to take a mink, fox or other fur bearing\\r\\nanimal so late or early in the season that the skin is not worth more\\r\\nthan one-third of what the same skin would have brought in a prime\\r\\ncondition?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 18th day of March, 1912, a neighbor, who had put in many a day\\r\\non the trap line with the writer, a man who with his three younger\\r\\nbrothers makes a business of trapping every season and makes good\\r\\nmoney, came to my house with a female fox skin that he had just\\r\\ncaught. I glanced at the skin and remarked that the skin was of but\\r\\nlittle value. My friend replied in an angry tone, \"No. It ain\\'t!\" And\\r\\nthat is not the worst of it--she would have soon had five young\\r\\nfoxes. I said, \"You will keep it right up, won\\'t you, Fred.\" \"No, I\\r\\nam done now,\" he answered. But I said, \"Fred, that is what you say\\r\\nevery year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin was large for a female fox, and had it been caught any time\\r\\nfrom November to the last of January, it would have brought five or\\r\\nsix dollars; but the best that he could get for the skin was three\\r\\ndollars. This is only one case of many, which came under my\\r\\nobservation, and especially in the case of taking skunks after they\\r\\nare so badly rubbed that they will not bring more than half the price\\r\\nof prime skins.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in the case mentioned above, of the female fox, the loss in the\\r\\nprice of the skin was small compared to that of the young foxes whose\\r\\nskins would have been worth, next November, or December, in the\\r\\nneighborhood of twenty dollars. In this particular case, my friend\\r\\nwould have got the most of those young foxes if not all of them, for\\r\\nthe fox den was on his premises, and not far from his house.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, comrades, let us stop this catching of unprime furs--it is our\\r\\nbread and butter. Let us stop wasting it, for there are but few\\r\\ntrappers, who have any more of this world\\'s goods than he needs. Let\\r\\nevery trapper do all that he can to put a stop to this waste of fur\\r\\nby catching the fur bearers, when their skins are not more than\\r\\none-half their value--and many are taken that are practically worthless.\\r\\nWe must do all that is in our power to stop a wasteful slaughter of\\r\\nthe fur bearing animals, for they are already becoming far too\\r\\nscarce; both for the trappers\\' benefit, as well as those who wear the\\r\\nfinished goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, instead of slaughtering the fur bearers during the season\\r\\nof unprime furs, let us look up our trapping grounds, for the coming\\r\\nseason, and have all preparations made, and our plans well laid. Then\\r\\nwhen the season of prime furs arrives, let us take to the trap line\\r\\nand follow it diligently for two or three months, then drop the fox,\\r\\nskunk, mink, coon and opossum and put in more time on beavers,\\r\\notters, and muskrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis applies to the middle, northern and southern states, while those\\r\\nin the far north, can, of course, continue to take the fox, mink,\\r\\netc., longer, but it is not good policy for the northern trapper,\\r\\neven to keep up the good work so long as to \"kill the goose that lays\\r\\nthe golden egg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nI notice that some of the comrades are complaining that they do not\\r\\nget a square deal from some of the fur buyers. Shame! shame!\\r\\nbrothers. Do you not know that the Fur Dealer is not even making a\\r\\nliving profit out of your pelts? That is the reason why there are so\\r\\nmany in the business. And do they not always urge the trapper to send\\r\\nin his furs early for fear there will be a drop in the price, and the\\r\\npoor trapper will lose on the price of his furs? Now, boys, can\\'t you\\r\\nsee that the average fur buyer is awfully good to the poor trapper?\\r\\nBut comrades, are not we, the trappers, partly to blame for this\\r\\nunfair deal? Are we careful that our furs are at least fairly prime\\r\\nand carefully cured and handled? Are we always careful when making\\r\\nour estimate to give a fair grade ourselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, comrades, we should always be careful to do, and then we should\\r\\nnever ship our furs only to parties who are willing to hold them\\r\\nuntil they have quoted what price they can pay for the bunch. If the\\r\\nprices are not satisfactory, the fur dealer should have agreed with\\r\\nthe shipper before the furs were shipped to him to pay one-half of\\r\\nall express charges, and either return the furs to the shipper or to\\r\\nany house in their city that the shipper may designate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, comrades, make some such bargain with your dealer, and if you do\\r\\nnot get a square deal do not be shy in giving the transaction with\\r\\nthe dealer\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, come down to camp and let us talk over\\r\\nthis question of the fast disappearance of the furbearing animals.\\r\\nThe fact of timber becoming scarce has made nearly every one\\r\\ntimber-mad--no, that is not right, I mean money-mad--and they wish to\\r\\nsecure this money through the fast increasing value of timber. In the\\r\\nlate sixties, right here in sight of where I am sitting, I saw as\\r\\nnice white pine cut and put into log heaps, burned up for the purpose\\r\\nof clearing the land, as ever grew.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, boys, I liken the trapper and the dig-\\'em-out and the dog-hunter\\r\\nto our ancestors in the wasting of timber, only our ancestors at that\\r\\ntime could not see the value of the timber that they were wasting.\\r\\nThe trapper, the dig \\'em-out and the dog-hunter are all money-mad,\\r\\nmade so by the high prices of fur. But unlike our ancestors, the\\r\\ntrapper, dig\\'em-out and dog-hunter should be able to see the folly in\\r\\ntaking the furbearers when in an unprime condition, because we all\\r\\nknow the difference in the value of a fox, a skunk, a mink, or the\\r\\nskin of any other fur-bearing animal taken in September or late in\\r\\nthe spring when unprime, than the same skins would be worth if taken\\r\\nin November or any month during the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI trapped in three different states in the South last season (1912)\\r\\nand I met with trappers and dog-hunters who admitted that they\\r\\ntrapped and hunted in September. We saw one trapper who had four\\r\\nlarge mink also quite a bunch of other furs, consisting of coon,\\r\\nmuskrats, civet and skunk; the trapper said that the mink were caught\\r\\nlast September or the first of October. He wanted six dollars for the\\r\\nfour mink. Just think of those four large mink being offered for six\\r\\ndollars and he could not get a buyer at that price. The rest of his\\r\\nearly caught furs ranked with the same grade as the mink. Comrades,\\r\\njust think that over and see how foolish we are to begin trapping so\\r\\nearly in the season. These same mink, had they been caught the last\\r\\nof November or in December, would have been worth, easily, six or\\r\\nseven dollars apiece. This same party had two mink that he had caught\\r\\nthe first of November and he asked five dollars apiece for them and\\r\\nthey were not near as large as those caught in September.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, brothers of the trap line, the most of us will admit that we are\\r\\nnot overstocked with worldly goods and we are not to be blamed for\\r\\ngetting a little money-mad; but when we get so money-mad that it\\r\\nmakes us so blind that we not only destroy our pleasure but we throw\\r\\naway from twenty-five cents on a muskrat and four to six dollars on a\\r\\nfox or mink we should stop and think!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile out in camp on our fishing trips this summer, let us invite all\\r\\nof the boys of the neighborhood to come and let us talk this matter\\r\\nover with them and show them how lame we are to indulge in this early\\r\\nand late trapping and hunting of the furbearing animals. Let us\\r\\ninduce the boys to become readers of the H-T-T, one of the greatest\\r\\nsporting magazines of the world, and through the columns of this\\r\\nmagazine, put up their fight for the protection of the furbearer and\\r\\nthe song birds. Unless the trapper puts up his own fight for the\\r\\nprotection of the furbearers, they will soon be exterminated. The\\r\\ndog-man is now trying to place a tariff on the trappers\\' bread and\\r\\nbutter in placing a bounty on the furbearer to induce the money-mad\\r\\ntrapper to destroy the furbearer during the summer when their fur is\\r\\nworthless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, let us have a little chat with the dig \\'em-outs or\\r\\nden-destroyers. Boys, what is the difference how the skunk or coon is\\r\\ncaught, whether by the steel trap or by dig\\'em-outs or by the dog; if\\r\\nthe animal is caught is it gone, isn\\'t it all the same? Well, it\\r\\nlooks to the fellow up the tree as though there was quite a\\r\\ndifference. Now comrades, if we dig out a skunk, that den, that\\r\\nhabitation is gone, is it not, and there is nothing left to induce\\r\\nother skunks to frequent that location. Now, as to hunting the coon\\r\\nand possum with the dog, two-thirds of the time the coon or possum is\\r\\ntreed in a den tree or rock and the tree is cut down and the rock or\\r\\nother den is destroyed and you will get no more coon or possum at\\r\\nthat place. If this work of destroying the dens of the skunk and the\\r\\ncoon is thoroughly practiced, the dens will soon be gone and with the\\r\\ndisappearance of the dens the skunk and the coon also disappear. If\\r\\nthe dig\\'em-out or dog hunter, when he found that he must destroy a\\r\\nden in order to get his game, would leave it or get the animals in\\r\\nsome other way without destroying the den, then there could be no\\r\\nobjection to the dig\\'em-outs or to dog-hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, comrades, I will give some of my own experience in regard to\\r\\nthis destroying of den trees. I trapped for a short time around a\\r\\nslough or pond in Alabama two years ago. The large timber in the\\r\\nvicinity of this pond was mostly oak and lumbermen were cutting this\\r\\ntimber and taking it out. Coon were quite plentiful around this pond\\r\\nwhen I first began trapping there but I soon noticed that signs were\\r\\nfast disappearing and I could not think what the cause was. I went to\\r\\nanother pond or rather a swamp about two miles from this pond where I\\r\\nagain found coon quite plentiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after I had moved my traps to this other slough a party of\\r\\nnegroes came to my camp; they had five dogs. I inquired what luck\\r\\nthey were having and they complained that since the timber had been\\r\\ncut around Swan Pond there were no den trees for coon or possum and\\r\\nthey were all gone. When these colored people told me what the\\r\\ntrouble was I could readily account for the fast disappearance of the\\r\\ncoon signs about the pond. I went to the same pond again this past\\r\\nseason and while I found a few signs I did not consider it worthwhile\\r\\nto put out a line of traps so I went on to the swamp and put out my\\r\\ntraps. It made me two miles further travel in that direction but it\\r\\npaid me just the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, let us induce all the boys to come to camp where we can\\r\\nconsult with them and let us get a move on us and locate our trapping\\r\\ngrounds and make all preparations for the trapping season. This will\\r\\nenable us when the fur is prime to make more money in two months than\\r\\nwe do in four months when we indulge in this September and unprime\\r\\nfur trapping. At the same time we will be able to lift our traps\\r\\nwhile there is still some of the furbearers left and we have not\\r\\n\"killed the goose that lays the golden egg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Passing of the Fur bearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, boys, I suppose you are well pleased with the bounty law in\\r\\nthis state, (Pennsylvania) as it now is? While it is doubtful if I\\r\\nshall ever again be able to follow the trap line, I am nevertheless\\r\\nas much, and perhaps more, interested in the welfare of the trapper,\\r\\nthan when I was able to follow a line of traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am inclined to think that the present bounty law (1907) will not\\r\\nonly be a damage to the trapper but also to the state. People who\\r\\nnever thought of trapping before are now preparing to trap, and some\\r\\nare already at it, and their cry is, Bounty! Bounty! It reminds me of\\r\\nJohn Chinaman when gold was discovered at Cripple Creek, Colorado.\\r\\nAll John could say in his rush for gold, was Cripple Creek, Cripple\\r\\nCreek! Fortunately the greater part of this class of trappers will\\r\\ncatch but few of the shyer animals (and the best fur bearers).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the Game Clubs that asked for and received the Bounty Law. Now\\r\\nif the bird hunter will leave his trained bird dog at home, and walk\\r\\nup to the birds he shoots, he will get plenty of exercise, and the\\r\\ngame birds will soon be more plentiful--but I suppose this would not\\r\\nbe sportsmanlike.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am well acquainted with a man who is a member of a Game Club; also\\r\\na game warden. A neighbor of mine who is a good trapper was visiting\\r\\nme a few days ago and he told me of a little matter that took place\\r\\nbetween the game warden and sportsman in question, and himself. My\\r\\nneighbor said that he was at the place of business of the Game Warden\\r\\n----, and he said to my neighbor, \"There are three traps you can have\\r\\nfor I have no use for them. My dog got in one of them, and I brought\\r\\nthe things home with me. I should have thrown them in the river.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my neighbor came to look at the traps he found his own private\\r\\nmark on the traps, so he said to the warden that they were his traps,\\r\\nfor there was his own private mark. The warden replied that he\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help that, and that there were three more over at the house\\r\\nthat he could get if he wanted to. When my neighbor went to get the\\r\\nother traps he found that they were not his traps, but he knew by the\\r\\nmark on them the traps belonged to his neighbor, so he told the\\r\\nwarden about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the intention of the true sportsman is to kill two birds with one\\r\\nstone through the Bounty Law; destroy the fur bearer, and by so\\r\\ndoing, do away with what I have heard many a true sportsman call a\\r\\nnuisance--the trapper and his traps. Apparently this state or its\\r\\nlawmakers, look upon the game business and the fur industry in a very\\r\\ndifferent light from what many do.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany states throughout the Union are enacting laws to protect the fur\\r\\nbearing animals of their respective states, and are only placing\\r\\nbounties on such animals as are of little use as fur bearers, and are\\r\\ndestructive to stock. No doubt but that these states look upon the\\r\\nhundreds of thousands of dollars put into the pockets of their\\r\\ncitizens through the trapper and his products, the same as they would\\r\\nupon equal amount of money brought into their respective\\r\\ncommonwealths through any other industry. I believe it would have\\r\\nbeen well to have had a bounty of $2.00 on a wild cat, and 50 cents\\r\\nor $1.00 on a weasel, and the same on hawks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to have a little private talk with the trappers of\\r\\nPennsylvania. I do not wish to go away from home to give advice, for\\r\\nusually unsought-for advice will reach about the same distance that\\r\\nthe giver\\'s hat rim does. Boys, remember that this is private--just\\r\\nbetween you and I. When we get ready to set our traps about the first\\r\\nof November, let\\'s try to--Oh, well, you kick, do you? You say that\\r\\nthe bounty trapper will have everything caught before the first of\\r\\nNovember. That is true to a certain extent, but we can\\'t help that,\\r\\nfor you know we are not true sportsmen, so all we can do is to stick\\r\\nto common sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I was about to say, boys, when we set our traps about the first\\r\\nof November, was, let\\'s try to set our traps so as to avoid catching\\r\\nour neighbor\\'s cats and dogs. If by mistake we should catch a\\r\\nneighbor\\'s cat, in freezing weather, and the cat\\'s foot is frozen,\\r\\nkill the poor thing at once and don\\'t let it out to remain a poor\\r\\ncripple the remainder of its life. And say, boys, don\\'t you think it\\r\\nwould be a good idea to get the consent of the farmers to allow you\\r\\nto set traps on their premises, wherever you can do so? And don\\'t you\\r\\nthink it would be best to be very careful to not break down the\\r\\nfarmer\\'s fences and leave their bars and gates open when we pass\\r\\nthrough them tending our traps? In fact, we should be very careful\\r\\nand do as little damage as possible, for you know we trappers are not\\r\\ntrue sportsmen. The true sportsman can buy or lease lands and have\\r\\ntheir private game preserves, so let us try to keep on the right side\\r\\nof the farmer or there will soon be a time when we will have no place\\r\\nto set our traps.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain game club men who are headed by a certain M. D. are\\r\\ncirculating a petition to both branches of the Legislature and the\\r\\nGovernor, to have a law passed to abolish bear trapping in\\r\\nPennsylvania. This M. D.\\'s excuse is a plea of humanity, claiming\\r\\nthat many bear are caught and allowed to remain in the trap until the\\r\\nbear gnaws or twists off his foot and often the bear is caught the\\r\\nsecond time and another is taken off, when the bear is destined to go\\r\\nthrough life on two feet. Now in all of my more than fifty years of\\r\\nbear trapping, I have never known a bear to gnaw his foot in the\\r\\nleast degree. Neither have I had a bear twist off his foot when\\r\\ncaught in a trap that has a spread of jaws no larger than 12 inches,\\r\\nwhich will catch a bear through the thick of a foot. The Newhouse No.\\r\\n5 bear trap which is the most common trap used in bear trapping, has\\r\\na spread of jaws of 11 1/4 inches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law which is now (1910) in force in this state provided that a\\r\\nbear trap must be looked to at least every forty-eight hours. Under\\r\\nthese conditions, there is no danger of a bear twisting off a foot.\\r\\nIt is true that if a trap is used with a grasp high enough to catch\\r\\nabove the foot and the bear is allowed to remain in the trap for a\\r\\nlong time, they will sometimes twist off a foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this sympathetic M. D. makes no mention of the bear that is\\r\\nwounded by a gunshot, escapes and lies for weeks, and then dies or\\r\\nrecovers as the case may be. The wounding of a bear from a gunshot is\\r\\nfar more liable to occur than it is to take a bear\\'s foot by being\\r\\ncaught in a trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sympathetic doctor makes no mention of the farmer who has a\\r\\nnumber of sheep killed by bears, which is almost an every day\\r\\noccurrence during the summer season in any section where bear\\r\\nfrequent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Brother Trappers, it is not the great sympathy that these\\r\\ngentlemen club men have for the bear. No, not in the least. What\\r\\nthese gentlemen want is to drive the lowly bear trapper out of\\r\\nbusiness, so that those very sympathetic gentlemen may more easily\\r\\nkill a bear without losing too much of their precious sweat, and not\\r\\nbe compelled to get too far from camp and the champagne bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Brother Bear Trappers, my object in writing these few lines is\\r\\nto ask you and each of you to write your respective representative at\\r\\nonce, advising him that you are opposed to any law to abolish the\\r\\ntrapping of the bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that I was the first to advocate some remedy against the\\r\\nwasteful slaughter of the fur bearing animals through the medium of\\r\\nour favorite magazine, the Hunter-Trader-Trapper. I urged that the\\r\\nremedy was with the large raw fur dealers by refusing to accept skins\\r\\nthat were not in a reasonably prime condition. Since my writing,\\r\\nother more capable writers have taken up the matter and have\\r\\nadvocated a remedy from the same standpoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow by close observation I have become satisfied that there is no use\\r\\nof looking further in that direction for a remedy of this wasteful\\r\\nslaughter of the fur bearing animals. The city fur dealers receive\\r\\nthe goods which consist of all manner of skins and all grades from\\r\\ngood to poor and worthless. In most cases the dealer received the\\r\\ngoods from local dealers who have gathered the furs up from among the\\r\\ntrappers, paying such prices as he thought would leave a fair profit\\r\\non the whole bunch. In most cases paying more for the poorer grade\\r\\nthan it was really worth, while paying far less than the prime skins\\r\\nwere worth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK ON THE TRAP LINE 1912.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the dealer was hardly to be blamed for this sort of transaction,\\r\\nfor it was the only way that he could make a deal with the trapper.\\r\\nThe city dealer is in the same fix as the local dealer. He quotes\\r\\nfurs from number one down to number four and trash, making up on the\\r\\nbetter grades what he may have lost on the poorer. Thus you see there\\r\\nis no one out anything except the trapper, who will insist on\\r\\ntrapping too early in the season, as well as too late in the spring\\r\\nof the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we will say to the brother trappers of Pennsylvania and other\\r\\nstates as well, that we are at the parting of the ways, allowing us\\r\\nto use the term. We must do something desperate if we wish to save\\r\\nthe fur bearers from becoming extinct and save the trappers\\' pleasure\\r\\nand what profit he may derive from the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the only remedy is a closed season on all fur bearing animals. If\\r\\nwe are to derive any special benefit from a closed season, the open\\r\\nseason must be made short, for every trapper of much experience knows\\r\\nthat the fur bearers of Pennsylvania have become extremely scarce in\\r\\nthe past few years. In fact in some parts there is but little stock\\r\\nleft to build on. I would say that not more than two months of open\\r\\nseason should be allowed, if we get real benefit from a closed\\r\\nseason, and taking the whole state into consideration, I believe that\\r\\nNovember and December would give the best general satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, brother trappers, do not be hard on me because I advocate a\\r\\nshorter season to be open than some trappers seem to be in favor of.\\r\\nWell, we had the bounty law and we all have seen the results. I would\\r\\nlike to say here that the bounty law is still doing its work of\\r\\nannihilation. The law is still in force as it appears on the face of\\r\\nit, but nevertheless there has been no appropriation made by the\\r\\nlegislature to pay the bounty. Some trappers do not know but what\\r\\nthey will get the bounty until they present these certificates for\\r\\npayment, then to learn that there is no bounty for them. Other\\r\\npersons and would-be trappers are getting the certificates and\\r\\nholding them, thinking that there will be an appropriation made to\\r\\npay this bounty. In this they will also find their mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, brother trappers, we all know that the Lord helps him, who helps\\r\\nhimself and if we would save the fur bearing animals from complete\\r\\nannihilation we must each of us do our part and not depend on some\\r\\none else doing the work. Let us all who would have a closed season on\\r\\nmink, fox, skunk and muskrat get a petition to that effect and\\r\\ncirculate it. Get your merchant, doctor, and every other business man\\r\\nin your neighborhood to sign the petition and as many others as we\\r\\npossibly can.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, my dear friends, let us remember that the gentleman sportsman\\r\\nwill not help us in this matter and if we would have a closed season\\r\\nwe must push this matter ourselves. In my upwards of fifty years on\\r\\nthe trap line and the trail, I have always done my part (as I saw it)\\r\\nto stop wasteful slaughter of game and the fur bearers and I will do\\r\\nthe very best that I am able in this matter, although I realize that\\r\\nmy days on the trap line are few.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, comrades, on the fourth of July (1910), the primaries to\\r\\nnominate candidates to represent the people of the commonwealth of\\r\\nPennsylvania, will be held. Let every trapper of the state, who is\\r\\ninterested in the matter of a closed season on our fur bearing\\r\\nanimals get out and talk with their candidates whom they wish to\\r\\nrepresent them at the next assembly. Let him know that you wish a law\\r\\npassed at the next legislature giving a closed season on fur bearing\\r\\nanimals. We should bear in mind, that writing and talking without\\r\\naction will not do. We must get busy at once if we would accomplish\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nDestruction of Game and Game Birds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late (1908) there has been much writing and law making in an\\r\\nattempt to preserve the game of this commonwealth, and it reminds one\\r\\nof the old adage of \"Locking the Barn Door, after the Horse was\\r\\nStolen.\" At the last Assembly of the Pennsylvania Legislature, there\\r\\nwas a Bounty Law passed with an appropriation of $50,000 to pay the\\r\\nbounty on the different animals. The appropriation was exhausted\\r\\nalmost before the trapping season had begun, or at least should have\\r\\nbegun, so far as the trapper\\'s interest was concerned. Now, I wish to\\r\\nspeak of the bounty as to fox and mink, and I wish to speak of an\\r\\nincident that came under my observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA neighbor of mine makes a business of trapping each fall; there were\\r\\nthree in the family, who trapped last fall. They caught 11 fox, 4\\r\\nmink, 8 coon, 2 weasel and 1 wildcat. This catch was all made before\\r\\nthe 20th of October and sold for $34.45, or including bounty, $66.45.\\r\\nNow, had this same fur been caught in November or December, the fur\\r\\nalone would have brought at least $68.00, and the taxpayers would\\r\\nhave been $32.00 ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also know of another party who dug out two nests of young mink and\\r\\ngot nine young ones. The old mink escaped. I asked this man why he\\r\\ndid not let them go until fall or winter, as these dens were near his\\r\\nmill? He informed me that he never fooled away any time trapping and\\r\\nhad he left them go until fall the mink would have been gone and now\\r\\nhe was $6.50 ahead. Now, this man had actually destroyed at least $30\\r\\nworth of furs to get $6.50 in bounty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I think that the bounty on wildcats and weasel is all right, I\\r\\ndo not think a bounty on fox and mink at all necessary. The high\\r\\nprice their fur brings will induce the trapper to take all that the\\r\\nbounty would induce him to do, and at a time when the fur will bring\\r\\nmore than a great deal of early caught furs would bring, including\\r\\nthe bounty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite doubtful as to mink being very destructive to birds or\\r\\ntheir nests, and as to the destruction of poultry, it is a very easy\\r\\nand inexpensive matter for any poultry raiser to arrange his poultry\\r\\nhouse so as to take any prowling mink that should come about his\\r\\npremises.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I would suggest to the bird hunter, or as he prefers to be\\r\\ncalled, \"sportsman,\" that if he will leave his automatic gun and his\\r\\nbird dog at home, and merely take a good double-barrel breechloader\\r\\nand go into the bush, and \"walk up\" his birds, instead of having a\\r\\ndog to show the bird to him, he will do far more to protect the game\\r\\nbird than any bounty law will do! This the sportsman must do, or the\\r\\ngame birds of this state will soon be a thing of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1870, there was a move begun to check the slaughter of the deer\\r\\nin this state, but it was only in a half-hearted way. The writer\\r\\ncirculated the first petition to get the law enacted prohibiting the\\r\\nhounding of deer. After some years the law prohibited the chasing of\\r\\ndeer with dogs, but the law could not be enforced for the very reason\\r\\nthat these same sportsmen wished to hound deer. He would go on to the\\r\\nstreams where there were but few inhabitants, and hire all of the\\r\\npeople living in the neighborhood to take their dogs to the hills and\\r\\nstart them on the trail of deer. The \"sportsman\" would lay in ambush\\r\\nand shoot the deer when they came to water, providing they were able\\r\\nto see the sights on their guns sufficiently clear to get a bead on\\r\\nthe deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese \"sportsmen\" would pay the natives a good sum for their services\\r\\nand would often buy hounds at high prices and bring them to the\\r\\nlocality where they intended to hound deer and pay some one living in\\r\\nthe neighborhood a good price to keep their dogs from one season to\\r\\nanother. These \"sportsmen\" were sure to make the constable, whose\\r\\nduty it was to report this violation of the deer law, a present of a\\r\\nfine fishing rod or some other article which might be a ten or twenty\\r\\ndollar bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, under these conditions it was next to impossible to get any one\\r\\nwho knew anything about the transaction to make a complaint, or even\\r\\nbe a witness against those transgressors of the deer or hounding law.\\r\\nBut in time the law was made sufficiently stringent as to virtually\\r\\nput a stop to this most cruel practice of deer hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now another bad thing came into vogue. Non-residents were allowed\\r\\nto go into the woods where they would camp from the first day of the\\r\\nopen season for deer until the close and often some days after. Now,\\r\\n\"the horse has been stolen.\" The deer in this state are virtually\\r\\ngone. \"The door has been strongly locked, but it is now too late.\"\\r\\nThis game rule applies to the game fish of the state and unless there\\r\\nare laws enacted which will apply more closely to the preservation of\\r\\nthe game birds, than a closed season and a bounty or scalp law, the\\r\\ngame birds will soon go the way of the deer and the game fish too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to say a word to our friends on the Pacific Coast as to the\\r\\nslaughter of game and especially that of deer. I saw a slaughter of\\r\\ndeer in nearly all of the states west of the Rocky Mountains that was\\r\\ncruel. In California, in 1904, I saw men kill deer seemingly for no\\r\\nother purpose than the desire to kill, or as I put it, the desire to\\r\\nmurder. I saw deer killed when the slayer positively knew that there\\r\\ncould not be any use made of the carcass. I saw deer killed when only\\r\\na fry would be taken from the ham, the remainder of the carcass left\\r\\nto lay without even the pretense of dressing. It was a common\\r\\noccurrence to kill deer for no other purpose than to feed dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day I was standing by a man on a sand bar on the bank of a river\\r\\nwhen we noticed a doe a few rods away looking at us. The man drew his\\r\\ngun to his shoulder in the act of shooting and I exclaimed, \"My God,\\r\\nman, you are not going to shoot that deer, are you?\" My words were\\r\\nnot out of my mouth when the gun cracked. The deer was mortally\\r\\nwounded and ran directly towards us, making desperate efforts to keep\\r\\nits feet. It fell dead within ten feet of where we were standing. I\\r\\nwalked away. The slayer of the innocent creature stood and gazed at\\r\\nit a moment and then with his foot he pushed it off the bar into the\\r\\nriver. I hope I may never see another such sight. It was June and the\\r\\ndoe was heavy with fawn and this man knew that he could make no use\\r\\nof this deer whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw much wasteful slaughter of deer but none quite so inhuman as\\r\\nthe one mentioned. The game laws of the Pacific Coast were not\\r\\nenforced. When well back in the mountains it was a rare thing to hear\\r\\nthe game laws spoken of, not even by the game wardens. Now I think\\r\\nthat all who are lovers of the woods and fields should join in a\\r\\ngeneral move to protect this wasteful slaughter of all game and game\\r\\nbirds, no matter whether we are the so-called \"pot hunter\" or the\\r\\n\"gentleman sportsman,\" but none will regret this unreasonable waste\\r\\nof game more than those who are living back in the mountains, where\\r\\ngame is most plentiful, when it is gone. Nor none will get more\\r\\nbenefit and pleasure from the very fact that they are living in a\\r\\ngame section, yet these are the ones who do not seem to care how\\r\\ngreat the slaughter, apparently never taking it into consideration\\r\\nthat the present rate of slaughter will soon leave their game laden\\r\\nsection as bare of game as that of the older settled countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades, let us all join in the preservation of what game and fish\\r\\nthere is left, whether we may be called pot hunters or gentlemen\\r\\nsportsmen. I would be the last one to wish to deprive any trapper or\\r\\ncamper from making good use of game at any time when in camp, but let\\r\\nus be careful about the waste of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, you of course are aware that a trapper is\\r\\nconsidered of small account by those who make or cause to be made,\\r\\nthe game laws of this state (Pennsylvania), and brother trapper, are\\r\\nwe not as much to blame as the ones who concoct the game laws to\\r\\ntheir own liking? The accompanying picture will show a part of the\\r\\nconfiscation from the writer by the game laws of Pennsylvania and\\r\\nthis same confiscation applies to every trapper in the state to a\\r\\nmore or less extent. Had we presented our side of this question to\\r\\nour respective representatives in a clear and reasonable light would\\r\\nwe not get a square deal? If not, then why not? We are aware that the\\r\\nman with the dollar has a great influence in comparison with the poor\\r\\ntrapper, but are there not ten of the poor trappers to one of the\\r\\ndollar men and have we not the just and reasonable side of the\\r\\nquestion? Do not our representatives know that the raw fur industry\\r\\nof the state is of greater importance, financially, than the wheat\\r\\ncrop of the state, for which the legislature does all it can in the\\r\\nway of appropriations to help the farmer to increase the yield of\\r\\nwheat? Had this been shown to the assembly, would it not have passed\\r\\nlaws to protect the fur-bearers of the state, instead of bounty laws\\r\\nto exterminate the fur-bearer, and this act at the expense of the\\r\\npublic?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery dollar that is appropriated by the House of Representatives in\\r\\nthe way of bounty on so-called noxious animals, must come from the\\r\\npockets of the taxpayers, and is not a dollar saved in the way of\\r\\nprotecting the fur-bearers of the state equivalent to a dollar\\r\\nproduced from a bushel of wheat? Now, the dollar man will tell us\\r\\nthat the fox and mink are very destructive to game and game birds.\\r\\nThis, to a great extent, is a mere bugaboo, or an excuse to knock out\\r\\nthe trapper. There is little doubt but that a fox occasionally kills\\r\\na grouse or partridge or a rabbit. Admitting this to be the case, is\\r\\nnot a good fox or mink skin worth ten times as much to the trapper as\\r\\na partridge or rabbit is to the dollar man?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is not all, if it is the pleasure of an individual to amuse\\r\\nhimself with the traps, why should he be deprived of that pleasure?\\r\\nIt is certain that the trap will not cause any more harm in the way\\r\\nof damage or in a cruel manner, than a dog will. While the dollar man\\r\\nmakes a plea in defense of game, it is generally known that his plea\\r\\nis in reality in defense of his manner of sporting, regardless of any\\r\\ndesires that the poor trapper may have and there are certainly but\\r\\nfew trappers but wish to see the game and game birds preserved as\\r\\nwell as the dollar man does.\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt if there is a man in the State of Pennsylvania who has worked\\r\\nlonger, or done more according to his ability, to protect and\\r\\npreserve game than the writer has, and as to the dog, he has no\\r\\ngreater friend than the writer. As to the preservation of game and\\r\\ngame birds, I believe in preserving it in a substantial way and not\\r\\nin a mythical manner, under the pretext of a bounty on noxious\\r\\nanimals and then pass laws that do away with the trap, the most\\r\\neffective implement there is in taking that noxious animal. As the\\r\\ngame and bounty laws of Pennsylvania stand today, it reminds one of\\r\\nthe old lady who told the boy that he could go in swimming, but he\\r\\nmust not go near the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I believe in a bounty on wildcats, hawks and weasel, sufficient\\r\\nto induce the poor man to spend the time necessary to exterminate\\r\\nthese animals when an opportunity comes to him, for the dollar man\\r\\nwill not take the trouble to do so. But the only effective bounty law\\r\\nmust be placed on the game man, in the way of cutting his bag limit\\r\\nof birds for a single day and the season in two, and placing a closed\\r\\nseason of five years on deer. There is much said as to the rapid\\r\\ndecrease of game. Now, so far as this applies to deer, and my\\r\\nobservation extends over four counties of the state, at the present\\r\\ndecrease (1913) of the deer, there will not be a deer left in these\\r\\nfour counties at the end of five years and the deer law is being\\r\\ncontinually violated. In order to enforce the game laws of the state,\\r\\nthe laws should be as near equal as possible, in giving each man his\\r\\nway of enjoying his manner of out-door sport, either in fishing,\\r\\nhunting or trapping. We are aware that there must be a limit to man\\'s\\r\\nidea of sport. There are plenty of men, for instance, who enjoy the\\r\\nuse of dynamite in fishing, in killing all the fish in the stream,\\r\\nsmall fish along with the large ones, also all kinds of fish that\\r\\nhappen to be in the pool where the dynamite is used. It may be the\\r\\npleasure of other sportsmen to kill birds of all kinds and also deer\\r\\nat any and all times of the year. This kind of work can not be\\r\\nallowed. In order to enforce the game laws, the laws must be in\\r\\nharmony with the greatest number of people possible, and not enact\\r\\ngame laws that deprives a goodly portion of the people (I refer to\\r\\nthe trapper) of their pleasure simply to gratify a certain class of\\r\\nsportsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game wardens will then find it hard enough to enforce the law.\\r\\nSay, comrades, I wish to call your attention to an article in the\\r\\nDecember number of H-T-T, 1912, by Mr. J. R. Bachelder. Mr. Bachelder\\r\\nis an old and respected man and one of the rural mail carriers of\\r\\nCameron County. Mr. Bachelder describes how the trap law of\\r\\nPennsylvania has deprived him of the only pleasure that he was able\\r\\nto enjoy in the open, that of tending a few traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd comrades, we of the trap line and trail, who are not blessed with\\r\\nthe dollar and the automobile, will soon find that our pleasures in\\r\\nthe open, like Mr. Bachelder\\'s, are laid by for all time. If the club\\r\\nman, through his leasing policies and the trespass law that he has\\r\\nbefore the House of Representatives, becomes a law, we can go away\\r\\nback and sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, comrades, I consider that we are to blame to a large extent for\\r\\nthese \"one man\" game laws. Had we come out at the right time and\\r\\nfought for our rights in the open instead of slinking back in the\\r\\ndark, whining, I believe that the law, as applied to the trap, would\\r\\nbe different and I should not violate the game laws after passed, no\\r\\nmatter if they are not wholly to my liking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professional sportsman makes a great talk about the amount of\\r\\nbirds that the fox destroys. Now, the facts are, one weasel or snake\\r\\nwill destroy more rabbits or birds and birds\\' eggs than a dozen\\r\\nfoxes. The fox gets the greater part of his food from the field\\r\\nmouse. This fact any close observer knows.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother trappers, you are aware that the nations--the United States,\\r\\nGreat Britain, Japan and Russia, have taken the fur seal under their\\r\\nprotection, and will protect the seal and sell their skins. I wish to\\r\\nask you, brother trapper, if your wife, daughter or sweetheart wears\\r\\nfurs made of the seal skin. No? Well, your wife, daughter or\\r\\nsweetheart does wear furs made from the fur bearer that runs on the\\r\\nhillside back of your house. Then, why do you stand for a bounty on\\r\\nthese animals from which the furs are made for your wife, daughter or\\r\\nsweetheart to wear, to hasten the extinction of these fur-bearers,\\r\\nwhile the millionaire gives the word to the government, and the\\r\\nfur-bearer of the millionaire is protected at the expense of the people?\\r\\nSay, you wives, daughters or sweethearts of the trapper, do you stand\\r\\nfor this kind of a deal?\\r\\n\\r\\nA few words in regard to the protection of the game and game birds: I\\r\\nthink that every lover of outdoor life should be willing to have a\\r\\nreasonable number to the bag limit of either game birds or game\\r\\nanimals, and lend a hand in protecting the game to the amount of the\\r\\nbag limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, you find fault with the game laws--you say that the laws are not\\r\\njust to all alike. Well, in one sense of the word this is true. The\\r\\nstate law confiscated your traps, then placed a bounty on noxious\\r\\nanimals, and then fines you heavily if you set a trap in a way so as\\r\\nto be able to catch one of these noxious animals (queer laws); but,\\r\\nnevertheless, we should try to protect our game if we are to have any\\r\\nleft. At the rate the game is being slaughtered at the present time,\\r\\nthere will not be a deer left in the State of Pennsylvania, and but\\r\\nvery little game of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say that it is a hard matter to protect the game--that is true;\\r\\nfor it is hard to get local game wardens that are of much account. A\\r\\nman of much principle and business qualifications will not accept the\\r\\nposition, as he does not like to arrest a neighbor for fear of\\r\\nhurting his regular line of business. The State Game Wardens are not\\r\\nacquainted with the different game localities, and with the people\\r\\nwho have but little or no regard for the game laws of the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will give an instance which came under my observation the past\\r\\nseason: The game laws of Pennsylvania prohibit the use of buckshot in\\r\\ndeer hunting, and the law also prohibits the killing of does. Now, a\\r\\nman who was hunting deer with a shotgun loaded with buckshot, was\\r\\nlooking at another hunter\\'s gun, which was a .32 Special Winchester;\\r\\nthe shotgun man noticed the small caliber of the Winchester, asked\\r\\nthe party who had the rifle (knowing nothing of the shooting power of\\r\\nthe Winchester), if he expected to kill anything with that little\\r\\nthing, and at the same time stating that good buckshot gun was the\\r\\nthing to hunt deer with. When asked if he did not know that the law\\r\\nforbade the use of buckshot in deer hunting, he replied, \"Oh to\\r\\n---- with the law!\" They knocked me out of my bear traps, and the next\\r\\nthing they will do is to pass a law to prohibit hunting with a gun\\r\\nthat costs less than $500.00.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, and in this same place, a party killed a large doe\\r\\nthat had its tail entirely shot away and several buckshot were found\\r\\nin its body.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will tell a little joke that was got off on one of the State Game\\r\\nWardens as told by himself in the hotel at this place, which is a\\r\\nfact, and took place in these same woods: The Warden was telling a\\r\\ncrowd at the hotel how his attention had been called to a doe that\\r\\nsome one had killed and hung up in a certain place in the woods. The\\r\\nWarden said he went and found the deer and watched for ten days, but\\r\\nno one came for the deer. A party standing by said to the Warden,\\r\\n\"Oh, that is a way we have of fixing you fellows--we kill a doe, hang\\r\\nit up on the outskirts of the deer hunting grounds, then give you\\r\\nnotice of it, and while you are watching the dead deer, we are\\r\\nkilling the live ones.\" The Warden, after listening to the man\\'s\\r\\nstory, remarked, \"Well by Jonathan! that is one on me--come on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above joke was actually got off here at the hotel in this town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of bears killed in this part, fall of 1911,\\r\\nnotwithstanding that the use of steel traps is prohibited, was larger\\r\\nthan has been in years. A party of thirteen from this place went into\\r\\nthe woods on the Trout River, and during the ten or twelve days they\\r\\nwere there, they killed seven bears--five in one day. And there were\\r\\nseveral deer killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow comrades, while we can\\'t all agree on the justification of the\\r\\ngame laws, we should all join hands and try to protect what little\\r\\ngame we have left by getting the bag limit materially cut down, and\\r\\ngive fifteen days more time to the hunter. Then stand by the law,\\r\\nor soon the game will all be gone with the exception of a few\\r\\ncotton-tails and what game is on private reserves, and posted lands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern Experiences on the Trap Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, I am not able to report a large catch of\\r\\nfurs the past season, 1910. I did not catch much fur, but say, boys,\\r\\nI had a good deal of experience nevertheless. I will try to tell of\\r\\nconditions as I found them in North Carolina.\\r\\n\\r\\nI first stopped in Lee County, where I met Mr. A. L. Lawrence, one of\\r\\nthe _Hunter-Trader-Trapper\\'s_ most ardent friends. After stopping\\r\\nhere a few days and seeing some of the sights in Lee and Moore\\r\\nCounties, Mr. Lawrence, now my friend and partner, a gentleman whom I\\r\\nhad never known before, started for Bladen Co., N. C., where we\\r\\nexpected to be kept up a good portion of the night in order to keep\\r\\nup with the skinning and stretching of the numerous furbearing\\r\\nanimals caught during the day. Well boys, I will say that we were not\\r\\ntroubled in this matter at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there is more fur in that section than in the north, there are\\r\\nalso more disadvantages to be met with, than we have here. The\\r\\nmajority of people that one meets with in the South are very kind and\\r\\nobliging. Nevertheless you will find it somewhat difficult to find\\r\\nsuitable grounds to set your camp, providing the parties are aware\\r\\nthat your intentions are to put out a line of traps. Remember that\\r\\nnearly every farmer has a drove of hogs that run in the woods, and\\r\\nthe feeding grounds of the razorback is in the bottoms along the\\r\\ncreeks and rivers. Naturally the farmer is a little fearful of his\\r\\npigs being caught, so he says that the better way is to keep \"shet\"\\r\\nof the trappers, especially those that are strangers to the\\r\\nneighborhood. This is not the only way that the razorback gets in his\\r\\nwork, and a good bit of work they get in too. The razorback is a\\r\\npowerful hunter, and it does not require a powerful animal scent to\\r\\ndraw the razorback to the trap. To avoid the porker the trap must be\\r\\nset three inches below the water or six feet above the ground. As\\r\\nfoxes are not given to tree climbing as a usual thing the trapper is\\r\\nsorely tried to devise schemes to take the fox in a section where the\\r\\nrazorback is getting in his work. He is found in most places in the\\r\\nSouth, although there are some counties and even townships that have\\r\\na stock law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great difficulty with a non-resident or a stranger in getting a\\r\\nsite to camp on, is that he must be where he can use the water from\\r\\nsome one\\'s well, as springs are not very plenty. The water in the\\r\\nbranches, small streams or rivers are not such that a trapper should\\r\\nuse; there is such a heavy drainage from swamps that are full of\\r\\ndecayed vegetation, so that the trapper would soon be looking for a\\r\\ndoctor rather than for opossum and coon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn South River near Parkersburg, we got a good place to camp, and the\\r\\npeople were very kind and neighborly. Mr. Green, the postmaster at\\r\\nParkersburg, and his family, with whom we stopped a short time before\\r\\ngoing into camp, were very kind and generous. The young ladies,\\r\\ndaughters of Mr. Green, gave us some fine music on the piano,\\r\\naccompanied with singing during the evenings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eighteen or twenty miles from Parkersburg on Turnbull Creek\\r\\nwhere we expected to do the greater part of our trapping, and where\\r\\nmink and coon were quite plentiful with considerable otter signs, we\\r\\nwere unable to get a place to camp. The people objected to outside\\r\\ntrappers infringing on what they apparently looked upon as their\\r\\nindividual right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the junction of Cape Fear and Black Rivers in Bladen and Pender\\r\\ncounties, there is a section of low swampy country, which is a wild\\r\\ncountry where there is deer and bear as well as furbearers such as\\r\\notter, mink, muskrats and coon. The latter are quite numerous. There\\r\\nis also wild turkey, quail and ducks on the river. Now this section\\r\\nof the country had a colony of mixed whites and colored people\\r\\n(Mulatto) who lived in these swamps, other people rarely going into\\r\\nthat locality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were informed that there was a good deal of illicit or Blockade\\r\\nWhiskey as the natives call it, made in these swamps. It is said that\\r\\nit is not safe for strangers to be caught in their domain too often.\\r\\nI found that one needs nearly double the number of traps to trap in\\r\\nthe swamps or bays, as these swamps are called by the natives. There\\r\\nis so much ground that is covered with water so near alike that the\\r\\nanimal has no regular place to travel, as is the case along the open\\r\\nstreams. Instead the animals have vast areas of ground to travel over\\r\\nthat is partially covered with water, so that the mink or raccoon\\r\\ntravels anywhere and everywhere, as it is all alike to the mink and\\r\\ncoon. Consequently the trapper needs more traps in order to make the\\r\\nsame number of catches as would be possible in a locality where the\\r\\nstreams did not spread over such a large scope of land.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the trapper in the South has but little snow or ice to contend\\r\\nwith, he will not find it all milk and honey, for the swamps are not\\r\\na paradise with the gall berry brush, the bamboo briers, saffron\\r\\nsprouts and holly brush. As for game birds, they are not so\\r\\nplentiful, but quail in places are found in good numbers. Wild\\r\\nturkeys are found in small lots scattered all over the country, but\\r\\nby no means plenty: doves are quite plentiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for fur bearers there are quite a number of opossum. Coons are not\\r\\nfound late in the season to any great extent only in the swamps where\\r\\nthey are quite plentiful. Grey foxes are plenty. There are many\\r\\nhunters in the South who hunt with dogs, and they do not take kindly\\r\\nto any other way of taking the furbearers. Otter signs are seen on\\r\\nnearly all of the streams but by no means are they plenty, and every\\r\\nslide is closely watched by trappers living nearby. The ever present\\r\\nrazorback is an obstacle in the way of otter trapping, for the trap\\r\\nmust be set under the water, and this is not always practical in\\r\\notter trapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not close this short letter without stating that our friend\\r\\nand partner, Mr. A. L. Lawrence, who was a native of Randolph County,\\r\\nN. C, was an expert trapper, and especially on mink. Mr. Lawrence was\\r\\na good cook as well as a good trapper. Mr. Lawrence was hard to beat\\r\\non baking opossum and bread making, but when it came to boiling water\\r\\nwithout burning it, your humble servant could hold him a close\\r\\nsecond.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay boys, I forgot to say that you will find Billy the Sneakum just\\r\\nas numerous in Dixie as he is in Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line, I am not in condition to write much at\\r\\nthis time owing to my health, but, later I hope to be able to give a\\r\\nfuller account of my trapping experiences of 1912 in Alabama,\\r\\nnorthern Georgia, northwestern North Carolina and southeastern\\r\\nTennessee. And Comrades, right here I wish to say that through the\\r\\nabove mentioned sections of the south, I found nearly every trapper a\\r\\nreader and lover of the _Hunter-Trader-Trapper,_ and many of these\\r\\nreaders seemed like old neighbors to the writer, when he met them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell boys, during all of last year, my health was such that I never\\r\\nagain expected to hit the trap line, but as the frost began to turn\\r\\nthe leaves of the timber on the hillsides, the trap fever became so\\r\\nhigh that I was compelled to take a half dozen traps and take to the\\r\\nbrush. The first night I got two foxes, the second night I got\\r\\nanother fox, three skunk and wife\\'s pet cat. The catching of Timy\\r\\n(the cat) caused wife to put up such a fight, that I was compelled to\\r\\npull the traps, pack my outfit and start for Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow boys, I am not going to tell you entirely of my own experience,\\r\\nbut of the experiences of other trappers and hunters as told me by\\r\\nthem. One trapper told of the killing of a bear in the thick cane\\r\\nbrakes in the swamps of the Mississippi. It was against the game laws\\r\\nof Mississippi to kill bear at that time of the year, and as these\\r\\nhunters could not resist the taking of this bear, they put up a job\\r\\non the bear. There were four of the hunters going through the thick\\r\\ncane brake, when they saw the bear coming toward them. The head man\\r\\npulled his hunting knife, and told the other hunters to lie down, he\\r\\ndropping to his knees, knife in hand. When the bear was close up to\\r\\nhim he sprang up and shouted \"boo\". The bear raised up on its hind\\r\\nfeet and the hunter seized the bear and plunged the knife into it.\\r\\nThe other hunters sprang to their feet, gun in hand and shot the\\r\\nbear. The party who told me this bear story, said it was a put up\\r\\njob, so as to make it appear that the bear was killed in self\\r\\ndefense.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: A PARTY OF VISITORS AT E. N. WOODCOCK\\'S CAMP ON THE\\r\\nBANKS OF THE ETAWAH RIVER AT DIKES CREEK, GA.]\\r\\n\\r\\nI know of many excuses to avoid game laws, but this one beats them\\r\\nall. I have had a good deal of experience in game hunting, but never\\r\\nhad the luck to have a bear run on to me in this manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will tell a panther story, which a man told me that happened some\\r\\nyear ago, in North Carolina, near the Tennessee line. The man was in\\r\\na small shack, and he often heard panthers screaming about the shack,\\r\\nand finally one night when he had some fresh deer meat in the shack,\\r\\nthe man was awakened by some animal trying to pull up a roof board.\\r\\nThe roof of the shack was not more than six or eight feet from the\\r\\nground floor, and soon the panther raised up a board sufficient to\\r\\nrun a foot down through the crack. The man stood watching the game,\\r\\nand when the foot came through the crack, the man seized the panther\\r\\nby the foot, and a terrible fight began. The hunter finally cut a\\r\\nfoot of the panther off, and stabbed it with his knife until he\\r\\nkilled it. The hunter had a rug made of the skin of this panther,\\r\\nwhich he intends to keep in the family for all time to come. I think\\r\\nthat this hunter is doing the right thing in so doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now give a little of my own experience, but it is not in the\\r\\nway of an adventure with either a bear or panther, but, no doubt, I\\r\\nwas just as nervous for a time as those who had the reported\\r\\nadventure with the bear and the panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last days of December, 1912, I went into camp about twelve or\\r\\nfourteen miles from Crandel, near the Tennessee line. Early the next\\r\\nmorning after going into camp, a man came to the camp and asked many\\r\\nquestions as to what I was doing. How long I was going to be there?\\r\\nWhere I was from? Also many other similar questions, and then went\\r\\naway. That evening four or five men came to my tent, and asked about\\r\\nthe same questions that the man in the morning had asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I stepped outside of the tent next morning, there were three or\\r\\nfour bunches of hickory withes standing against the guy ropes of the\\r\\ntent. I did not know what those hickory withes meant, but surmised\\r\\nthat some jealous trapper had put them there as a warning for me to\\r\\nget out. But it was not long after daylight, when a man came to camp,\\r\\nand said that I was suspicioned of being a spy in search of\\r\\nblockaders. I told this man that there could be nothing farther from\\r\\nit, that that would be the last thing I would mix up in, even if I\\r\\nknew of any such business, that I was simply a trapper and had no\\r\\nother business there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, said that he knew that as soon as he heard my name for he\\r\\nhad known of me for the past four years, ever since he had been a\\r\\nreader of the _H-T-T._ This gentleman told me not to worry, but to\\r\\nstay in my tent a day or two before going out to set my traps, and\\r\\neverything would be all right. I hardly knew what to do, but as it\\r\\nwas raining I could not well break camp that night. Five or six men\\r\\ncame to camp. Some were those who had been there before, and\\r\\nquestioned me as to my business there. But now they were acting\\r\\nentirely different. Now these gentlemen rushed in with hands extended\\r\\nto shake hands and welcome me and offer me any assistance that they\\r\\nwere able to give, and nearly all of them offered me a drachm of corn\\r\\njuice. I stayed a few days longer in camp there, and each day friends\\r\\ngrew more numerous and corn juice more plentiful. I stayed a day or\\r\\ntwo and saw that friends were going to be so numerous that it would\\r\\nbe next to impossible for me to get out on the trap line for some\\r\\ndays at least, so broke camp and pulled for Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Trap and Trot Line in the South--Fall of 1912.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, comrades of the trap line, as I see so many interesting letters\\r\\nfrom trappers in the H-T-T, the best of all sporting magazines, I\\r\\nwill relate some of my experiences in the South, season of 1912.\\r\\nDuring the latter part of the winter and the greater part of the\\r\\nsummer, my health was so poor that I never again expected to be able\\r\\nto enjoy the pleasures of the trap line. But as time passed and I was\\r\\nable to get out into the fields and wander about, I became stronger\\r\\nfrom day to day until in the last days of October, when the frost\\r\\nbegan to crisp the air and the leaves on the trees on the hillsides\\r\\nbecame a golden hue, it drove the trapping fever into me to such a\\r\\ndegree that I was unable to resist the temptation any longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took six or eight traps and went to the brush within sight of the\\r\\nhouse. I was obliged to use a good, strong staff to climb the hill\\r\\nwith and could only take a few steps at a time, without stopping to\\r\\ntake my breath. But, boys, I found this sort of exercise better for\\r\\nme than the doctor\\'s medicine that I was taking. My first night\\'s\\r\\ncatch was two fox. Many of the readers of the H-T-T will remember of\\r\\nseeing my picture with the two fox in the December, 1912, number. The\\r\\nnext two nights I got another fox and three skunk and wife\\'s pet cat.\\r\\nThe cat business put it up to me and I was compelled to lift my traps\\r\\nand take for other fields. Had I been able to traverse the hills and\\r\\nwoods of old Potter County, I could have done far better than I did\\r\\nin the South.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy trapping fever had now reached such a high mark that I could no\\r\\nlonger stave it off and not being able to travel the hills and\\r\\nstreams of this section, hit my feet for Alabama, where I could do\\r\\nthe greater part of my work from a boat. After reaching Tryanna, I\\r\\nmade a trip up Indian Creek every day by boat to a fish trap dam,\\r\\nwhich I was unable to get the boat over so was compelled to leave it\\r\\nat the dam and hoof it up the creek to the end of the line. On the\\r\\nway back down the creek each day I would gather up a boat load of\\r\\ndrift wood to last for the day. The water being at a very low stage,\\r\\nit caused several rapids, which made it tight nipping to paddle the\\r\\nboat over. I had occasion to stop paddling often as I was continually\\r\\nmaking sets for mink, rats, coon and opossum, first on one side of\\r\\nthe stream and then on the other, so that I had abundance of time to\\r\\nrest. But, comrades of the trap line, this kind of work is much\\r\\nbetter for an old played-out trapper than pills.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I found trapping conditions here in Alabama different than they\\r\\nwere a year ago, I nevertheless got a mink, rat, \\'possum or coon\\r\\nnearly every day, but two mink at a single round of traps was the\\r\\nbest that I did at any time. There was no otter or beaver in this\\r\\npart of Alabama and but very few fox or skunk, and I found far more\\r\\ntrappers than there were a year ago. Many of the trappers were from\\r\\nother states, and last season I did not see or hear of a colored man\\r\\ntrapping, but this fall I heard of the dark man and his works daily.\\r\\nOne of the worst and most foolish things that the trappers did was\\r\\ntheir early trapping before furs were any where near in a prime\\r\\ncondition. This unwise work was indulged in by the white trappers as\\r\\nwell as the negroes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was unable to get out into the swamps or sloughs to any great\\r\\nextent and it is in the swamps that the coon are found more\\r\\nplentifully. The mink does not take to the swamps as readily as the\\r\\ncoon, nevertheless he is found in the swamps as well as along the\\r\\nrivers and smaller streams. If we could only keep down the trapping\\r\\nfever and the desire to get that mink before the other fellow did, it\\r\\nwould help us out in a financial way. We saw many mink that were\\r\\noffered for sale here that were over three feet from tip to tip, from\\r\\n75 cents to $2.00, and the skins went a-begging at that price. Now,\\r\\ncomrades, just think of the difference in what those skins would have\\r\\nbrought when in a prime condition. The price then would have been\\r\\nfrom $3.00 to $7.00, and this same rule applied to the coon and\\r\\nmuskrats and other fur bearers, and you are aware that the fur\\r\\nbearers throughout the country are rapidly becoming scarcer each\\r\\nyear. While I found more mink, coon and muskrats here in Alabama than\\r\\nI did in either Georgia or North Carolina, yet I did not see mink,\\r\\ncoon or rat signs in comparison to what they were a year ago, and I\\r\\ndo not believe that there was one-third as many mink, coon or\\r\\nmuskrats as there was last season. Opossum seem to hold their own\\r\\nfairly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, comrades, the picture here shows the greater part of our\\r\\nAlabama catch of furs. I trapped in Alabama about three weeks when I\\r\\nwent to Georgia, where I expected, from what I was told, to find far\\r\\nbetter trapping than was to be had here in Alabama, but I was sadly\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving Tryanna, Alabama, by wagon, I went to Farley, eighteen miles.\\r\\nThere I took a train to Huntsville, then by the Southern R. R. by the\\r\\nway of Chattanooga to Dikes Creek, Georgia, where I went into camp. I\\r\\ncamped at this place about two weeks, building two boats, one a good\\r\\nlarge boat, sufficient to move my whole outfit from point to point,\\r\\nas I moved down the Etowah River, then the Coosa River. The other\\r\\nboat was much smaller, being suited to the trap and trot line. Boys,\\r\\nyou who have trapped on the rivers and large streams of the South,\\r\\nknow that the traps and the trot line go hand in hand and with only\\r\\ntwo or three trot lines, to one who is onto the job, you will find\\r\\nthem quite profitable as well as a pleasure. In most places you will\\r\\nfind ready sale for the fish you catch at 10 to 12 cents a pound. If\\r\\none runs his trot lines two or three times a day and takes in from 20\\r\\nto 100 pounds of fish, it is a little item along the financial trail.\\r\\nBut, boys, there is a knack in running a trot line in a successful\\r\\nmanner as well as a trap line. Where the trot line is run in\\r\\nconnection with the trap line, it makes quite an addition to the\\r\\ntrapper\\'s job, for he will be out as late as 9 or 10 o\\'clock before\\r\\ngoing to bed to run the trot lines, take off the fish and rebait the\\r\\nlines. It is also necessary to put in any spare time that happens\\r\\nyour way in digging wigglers, hunting crawfish and other bait.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: E.N. WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS 1912 CATCH OF ALABAMA\\r\\nFURS.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat is an absolute necessity in trapping in the South, as the\\r\\nmost of the fur-bearers are found along the rivers and large streams.\\r\\nIt is next to an impossibility to make a successful set for mink and\\r\\ncoon along the soft, slippery and sloping banks without the boat. And\\r\\nboys, the conditions on the trap line in the South are altogether\\r\\ndifferent from what it is in the North on the clear, gravelly and\\r\\nrocky streams of the North and East sections. It requires a trap one\\r\\nsize larger in the South in successful trapping than it does in the\\r\\nNorth and East. This is owing to the soft, muddy, clay banks and\\r\\nstreams. Another thing that is a necessity along the rivers and\\r\\nstreams of the South is the trap stake, while on most streams of the\\r\\nNorth the clog or drag is far better than a stake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not find the fur-bearers in Georgia as plentiful as I expected,\\r\\nfrom what I had been told and trappers were numerous, many of them in\\r\\nhouse boats. I expected to find some beaver on Pumpkin Vine Creek, a\\r\\nbranch of the Etowah River, but they failed to show up on\\r\\ninvestigation. There is but very few otter in northern and central\\r\\nGeorgia and in Georgia, as in Alabama, many trappers began trapping\\r\\nin September. The best catch in one night at our camp was while we\\r\\nwere camping at Coosa, on the Coosa River, but it was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to what we did in Alabama last season in a single night\\'s\\r\\ncatch. The catch at Coosa in one night was two mink, three coon,\\r\\nthree rats and two opossum. This was done with about 20 traps. It was\\r\\nraining at this time, so we kept this bunch of furs three days and\\r\\nuntil there had been several more pieces added to the bunch. We\\r\\nwanted to get a picture of this bunch of furs and the camp at this\\r\\nplace but it continued to rain and we were compelled to skin the\\r\\nanimals and let the pictures go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steamboats are a serious drawback to the trappers on the river in\\r\\nthe South. The average trapper plans to get out on his line and fix\\r\\nup as many of his traps as he can after the steamboat passes. On most\\r\\nrivers there is not more than one or two boats passing daily and on\\r\\nsome of the rivers, boats do not make more than one or two trips a\\r\\nweek. It was the intention of the writer when going to Georgia, to\\r\\nwork the trap line all winter, going nearly the entire length of the\\r\\nAlabama River, to the Mississippi line, but met with unexpected\\r\\nconditions that I was unable to endure and was compelled to give up\\r\\nthe greater part of the trip, which was a sad disappointment. But\\r\\ncomrades, you know that there are but few trappers but what meet with\\r\\ndisappointments at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game laws of Georgia are a little hard on the trapper and\\r\\nfisherman. The non-resident trapper has to pay a license of fifteen\\r\\ndollars and the local trapper a license of three dollars. (This\\r\\nalludes to the laws of 1912.) That is not the worst part of it. In\\r\\nfact, the license fund, if justly used in the protection of game and\\r\\ngame birds and the propagation of game and birds, I would not object\\r\\nto the license.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hard part of the game law of Georgia is the trespass part of it.\\r\\nThe trapper must have a written permission from the land owner to\\r\\ntrap or fish on any man\\'s land and where the river is the dividing\\r\\nline between different parties owning the land, the trapper or\\r\\nfisherman must have the written permit from both land owners, even\\r\\nthough he does not leave his boat to set a trap or place a trot line.\\r\\nNow it is a very difficult thing for a stranger to learn who owns the\\r\\nland and often the owner of the land lives in some city of the North,\\r\\nor elsewhere. Now here is where the shoe pinches the hardest. The\\r\\nfine for trespassing on a man\\'s land is $40.00 and it is the duty of\\r\\nthe game warden to arrest any one he finds hunting, trapping or\\r\\nfishing on any man\\'s land without a written permit. Here is the worst\\r\\nof all. The game warden must make the arrest without any notice from\\r\\nthe land owner and if the game warden fails to make the arrest, he is\\r\\nliable to the same fine as the one who is doing the trespassing. This\\r\\nis a law that the average land owner never asked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had men come to me every day and offer me the privilege of trapping\\r\\nor hunting on their land without any request on my part. I found the\\r\\nmajority of the people of Georgia very kind in regard to this\\r\\ntrespass matter as well as other matters. It was only a few sporting\\r\\n\"Nabobs\" that concocted this stringent part in the trespass law,\\r\\ncontained in the game laws of Georgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost other states of the south have as trespass laws, that the land\\r\\nowner must order the arrest. The laws of Alabama allow or at least\\r\\ncan not stop the trapper or fisherman from trapping or fishing so\\r\\nlong as he keeps within the boundary limits of the river, which is\\r\\nsufficient to give the trapper or fisherman ample ground to camp on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving the Coosa River I went into the extreme northern part\\r\\nof Georgia where I camped for about three weeks and never met a more\\r\\nfriendly class of people than within the vicinity of Oakman and\\r\\nRanger. After leaving this section, I went into camp near Crandel,\\r\\nGa. From there I went into the Fog Mountains, where I found game\\r\\nfairly plentiful but owing to bad weather and the condition of my\\r\\nhealth, did not hit the trap line very heavy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrapping in Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, comrades of the trap line, as I am getting well up to the\\r\\nseventy notch, and as the chills of zero weather chases one after the\\r\\nother up and down my spinal column, like a dog after a rabbit in a\\r\\nbriar patch, and as I am unable to shake off that desire for the trap\\r\\nline, I concluded to go south again to trap. I began an inquiry in\\r\\nseveral different sections, in states of the South, and finally\\r\\ndecided upon Alabama, where a gentleman and a brother trapper by the\\r\\nname of Ford had invited me to come. On the last days of October,\\r\\n1911, I arrived in Alabama where I met Mr. Ford, whom I found to be a\\r\\ngentleman in all respects, and a member of the M. E. Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first day\\'s outing after reaching Mr. Ford\\'s place was on the\\r\\nTennessee River, raising fish nets, and putting out a few mink traps\\r\\nto ascertain what the complexion of the inner side of a mink\\'s coat\\r\\nwas. I got a mink the first night, which I found to be of fairly\\r\\nlight color, but not quite light enough to my liking. The setting of\\r\\nmore traps was delayed for a few days and we spent the time in\\r\\ntending the fish nets.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have whipped the streams and drowned earthworms for brook trout and\\r\\nother fish, from my childhood days to the present time. I had never\\r\\ndone any fishing in large rivers with nets, so you can imagine my\\r\\nfeelings when one net after another was raised which contained many\\r\\nfish of different kinds, such as yellow cat, channel cat, buffalo,\\r\\npickerel, pike, carp, suckers, black bass (called trout in the South)\\r\\nand many other kinds. These fish ran in weight all the way from\\r\\none-fourth pound up to twenty pounds each, and occasionally a buffalo or\\r\\nyellow catfish much larger. Mr. Ford informed me that often on trot\\r\\nlines they got sturgeon, weighing more than one hundred pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe intended to put out a trot line and catch a sturgeon that I might\\r\\nget some oil. It is said that the oil from a sturgeon is a sure cure\\r\\nfor rheumatism in the joints, but it rained so much, keeping us busy\\r\\nadjusting our traps, that we did not get any time to get the bait and\\r\\nput out the trot line. So I did not get to see one of those large\\r\\nfellows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Ford pointed out corn and cotton fields where the corn and cotton\\r\\nwas still ungathered and told me that he had trot lines set out all\\r\\nthrough these fields last spring and caught hundreds of pounds of\\r\\nfish--it hardly seemed possible as the water was then fifteen of\\r\\ntwenty feet below the banks of these fields. But in December when it\\r\\nbegan raining nearly every day, and the water rose so suddenly that I\\r\\nwas obliged to leave many of my traps where I had set them around\\r\\nponds and banks of streams and in the swamps, I could then readily\\r\\nsee that it was perfectly possible for the fish to get out into the\\r\\ncorn and cotton fields to feed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rainy season set in nearly a month earlier this season than\\r\\nusual, causing the rivers and streams to rise so as to flood the\\r\\nwhole bottoms (it is called the tide by the people in Alabama).\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not give my views of the country and conditions in northern\\r\\nAlabama--it would not look well; it is sufficient to say that the\\r\\ngreater part of the land is owned in large tracts by a few men and\\r\\nleased out at from $3.00 to $4.00 per acre. Corn and Cotton are the\\r\\nmain crops. Any land lying above the overflowing sections requires\\r\\nheavy fertilizing in order to make a crop. The fertilizer is the\\r\\ncommercial sort, and all the crop will sell for is put onto the land\\r\\nin the way of fertilizers. These lands are mostly leased to colored\\r\\npeople--in fact, I was told that the landlords did not care to lease\\r\\nto white men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor white man in northern Alabama is worse off than the colored\\r\\nman, for he is looked upon as neither white nor black. In this\\r\\nsection the population is largely of the colored class. All of the\\r\\nlandlords have a store, so as to furnish their tenants with goods of\\r\\nan inferior quality at exorbitant prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no good water to be found in that part of Alabama. The water\\r\\nthat the people use is something fearful--of course the wealthy class\\r\\nhave cisterns. The soil is mostly red clay, and terrible to get about\\r\\nin when the least damp. The roads are only names for roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the Tennessee River is what is called the Sand Mountains;\\r\\nthe soil is of a sandy nature, freestone water, and the people are\\r\\nall white--in fact, it is said that they will not allow a colored man\\r\\nto live there. I heard it stated that they would not even allow a\\r\\nnegro to stop over night in that section.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sand Mountain region is a piney country with a sandy soil. The\\r\\nland is not as fertile as the bottom lands along the Tennessee River,\\r\\nbut they produce a finer grade of cotton, which brings a cent or two\\r\\na pound more than that of the bottom lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to game in north Alabama, there is but little large game to be\\r\\nfound. In the extreme northern part of Madison county, well up to the\\r\\nTennessee line, there are a few deer and wild hogs; it was said that\\r\\nthere were some bear, also plenty of wild turkeys. There were plenty\\r\\nof ducks, and a good many quail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still some lumbering being done, mostly in oak of different\\r\\nkinds, though a good part is white oak. The logs are cut and hauled\\r\\nto the Tennessee River and taken by steamboat to Decatur in Limestone\\r\\nCounty, and worked up into lumber and manufactured articles. There is\\r\\nstill quite large bodies of cugalo gum left in the swamps, though\\r\\nthis timber is not yet used to any great extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish to say that if the trapper expects to ship his camp outfit by\\r\\nfreight to any part of the South, he should start it from four to six\\r\\nweeks in advance of the time that he will arrive at the place where\\r\\nhe will use it. The trapper, as a usual thing, is too shallow in the\\r\\nregion of the pocket book to afford to ship an outfit of camp stove,\\r\\ncooking utensils, tent and a hundred traps or more of various sizes,\\r\\nby express. Of course, he can take his bed blanket and extra clothing\\r\\nas baggage in his trunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to make this matter plainer, I will give my experience of the\\r\\nlast two seasons. In 1910 I trapped here in Pennsylvania the first\\r\\ntwo weeks of November before going south. So shipped my camp chest by\\r\\nexpress to Cameron, N. C, started it four days before I started so as\\r\\nto be sure that it would be there by the time I arrived. But when I\\r\\ngot to Cameron there was no express matter for Woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive days later while I was standing on the depot platform at Cameron\\r\\nwaiting for the eleven o\\'clock express train, along came a freight\\r\\ntrain, stopped and put off my camp chest. Now, the express charges on\\r\\nthis chest was something over ten dollars on 180 pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next season I concluded that I would not give the express company\\r\\nanother rake-off, so started my camp outfit by freight for Madison,\\r\\nAlabama, four weeks before I started, so as to again be sure that it\\r\\nwould be there when I arrived. Mr. Ford met me at the station nine\\r\\nmiles from his place with a conveyance to take baggage and camp\\r\\noutfit to his place. And boys, imagine my feelings when I was again\\r\\ntold by the station agent that there was nothing there for Woodcock.\\r\\nAbout a week later, I got the goods. So boys, take the hint and start\\r\\nthe outfit well ahead if you wish to get it on time. I have had other\\r\\nsimilar experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our way back to Mr. Ford\\'s place the day he met me at the station,\\r\\nhe called my attention to several different places along the road to\\r\\nmink tracks in the ditches and in the road. I thought that it would\\r\\nbe no trick at all to take three or four mink each night, but I was\\r\\nnot reckoning on the disadvantages I had to contend with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section of the country is very thickly settled with colored\\r\\npeople, and each family keeps from one to three dogs, which are out\\r\\nsearching for food all the time. These people never think of feeding\\r\\ntheir dogs. Nearly every night these colored people are out hunting\\r\\nin droves of five or six, and with six or eight dogs. They think it\\r\\nno more of a crime to steal a trap, and anything found in the trap,\\r\\nthan they would consider it a crime to eat a baked \\'possum. A trapper\\r\\nmust keep a good lookout when setting his traps to see that there is\\r\\nno \"dark object\" anywhere in sight. If there is, you may expect that\\r\\nthat particular trap will be missing the next time you come that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn setting a trap, the first thing to do is to select a place where\\r\\nthe trap is to be set, then look carefully around to see that no\\r\\n\"dark object\" is in sight; then go into the bush and get the trap,\\r\\nstake and everything that you will use in making the set. Then you\\r\\nwill again look carefully for that \"dark object,\" and will proceed to\\r\\nmake the set, provided that yourself is the only human being in\\r\\nsight, stopping your work often to look about you. Do not think that\\r\\nthis caution is not necessary, for it sure is. The writer had nine\\r\\ntraps taken at one time within an hour after he had been over the\\r\\nline.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went into our first camp, I think, on the 5th of November, at a\\r\\nplace called Blackwell\\'s Pond or Blackwell\\'s bottom, I am not sure\\r\\nwhich. The first day after we got to camp, Mr. Ford went out and put\\r\\nout a few traps, while I stayed in camp and fixed up things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we went out to look over the ground a little while.\\r\\nMr. Ford went to the opposite side of the pond to set a few more\\r\\ntraps, and see parties who owned land along the pond, for we found\\r\\nthat the land had been posted \"No Trespassing.\" When Mr. Ford came in\\r\\nthat evening I think he brought in five rats. We set nine traps that\\r\\nday and went south along the pond to look over the grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning we had one mink and one coon in the nine traps. I\\r\\nthink Mr. Ford brought in four rats and had one coon foot. That\\r\\nevening Mr. Ford went home to raise his nets, and when he came back\\r\\nhe brought in two mink; I got two coon. Mr. Ford went home again and\\r\\nmade arrangements for a team to come in and move us out to \"pastures\\r\\nnew.\" He also brought another mink, and I believe that we got two or\\r\\nthree coons that night. I think we got nine rats, four mink and eight\\r\\ncoons in the three nights with about twenty traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land about this pond had been leased by Mr. Edmon Toney, a\\r\\nwealthy young man living near the place. While Mr. Toney is wealthy,\\r\\nhe insists in indulging in the meek and lowly occupation of the\\r\\ntrapper. We know Mr. Toney to be a successful trapper, for he caught,\\r\\nwhile we were in camp at that place, one of the wealthiest and most\\r\\nbeautiful young ladies in that section. Mr. Toney is a reader of the\\r\\nH-T-T.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur next camp was on Little Indian creek, at the edge of a large\\r\\ncugalo swamp not the pleasantest place that one could wish for a\\r\\ncamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: E. N. WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS ALABAMA FURS.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day after we went into Camp No. 2. I set a few traps near\\r\\ncamp. Mr. Ford went down the creek toward his place and set a few\\r\\ntraps, and went home to look after his fish nets, returning to camp\\r\\nthat evening. Mr. Ford had warned me that the mink in that section\\r\\nwould foot themselves equally as bad as muskrats, but as I had never\\r\\nbeen bothered with mink footing themselves, I paid no attention to\\r\\nhis warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Mr. Ford stepped outside of the tent--it was about\\r\\nfive o\\'clock and called to me, asking where I had set my first trap\\r\\non the creek, and being told, he replied, \"Well, you have caught a\\r\\nmink.\" When asked how he knew, he said, \"Come out and hear him\\r\\nsquall.\" I ate breakfast and hastened down to release the mink, but\\r\\nmy haste was unnecessary for the mink did not propose to wait for me,\\r\\nI found only the mink\\'s foot--the mink had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never had a mink foot itself in this way before and did not\\r\\nthink that the mink did, although here in Alabama, we had two mink to\\r\\nfoot themselves in one night. Had I heeded Mr. Ford\\'s warning, I\\r\\nwould have been several mink pelts ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there was considerable fur to be found in the vicinity of Camp\\r\\nNo. 2, it was a hard place to camp, owing to the scarcity of camp\\r\\nwood and the inconvenience of getting water, so we moved on to Beaver\\r\\nDam creek, in Limestone county, where we were in hopes of finding a\\r\\nfew beaver and quite a plenty of mink and coon. But we were sadly\\r\\ndisappointed; we found but little to trap, but found trappers and\\r\\ntrap-lifters in abundance, so made haste to get out of that country\\r\\nwhile we had our boats left. Our catch was only two mink, twelve\\r\\nrats, five coon and one or two \\'possum.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved from this place back into Madison County and pitched our\\r\\ncamp at a point known as the Sinks, where we did a better business.\\r\\nBut the rainy season soon set in, so we were compelled to break camp\\r\\nand get out, leaving a good part of our traps where we had set them,\\r\\nnow under several feet of water. We shall never see them again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell boys, you will excuse me from telling just how many coon we got\\r\\nin an hour and seven minutes. I can only state that during the\\r\\nfive weeks that Mr. Ford and the writer were in camp that we got\\r\\ntwenty-six mink. I do not remember the number of coons, opossums and rats\\r\\ncaught.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Early Experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades of the trap line and trail, as I have gotten too old, March\\r\\n1913, and too nigh played out to longer get far out into the tall\\r\\ntimber, I will, with the consent of the editor of the H-T-T, relate\\r\\nsome of my experiences on the trap line and trail of some years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young man by the name of Frank Wright was hunting and trapping on\\r\\nthe Crossfork waters of Kettle Creek. Frank was a young man barely\\r\\nout of his teens, and had been in the woods but little, but Frank was\\r\\na hustler and was not afraid of the screech of the owl; the days were\\r\\naltogether too short for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went into camp early in October as we had to do a good deal of\\r\\nrepairing on the camp as the cabin had not been used in two or three\\r\\nyears, and the porcupines got in their work in good shape. The cabin\\r\\nwas built of logs and the \"porces\" had gnawed nearly all of the\\r\\nchinking out from between the logs and the mud was all gone from\\r\\naround the chinking. Some of the shakes were gone from the roof and\\r\\nthe door which was made of split shakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we split out shakes and repaired the roof and the door. We\\r\\nthen split chinking block out of a basswood tree to renew the\\r\\nchinkings that had been gnawed and eaten up by the porcupines. After\\r\\nthe chinking was all replaced and fastened in place by making wedges\\r\\nand driving them into the logs, one at each end of each chinking\\r\\nblock, we gathered moss from old logs and calked every crack,\\r\\npressing the moss into the cracks with a wedge-shape stick made for\\r\\nthe purpose. The calking was all done from the inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the chinking and calking was done, we dug into a clay bank and\\r\\ngot clay, which we mixed with ashes taken from the fire then added\\r\\nsufficient water to make a rather stiff mortar. We filled the spaces\\r\\nbetween the logs, going over every crack on the outside of the shack.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow and again Frank would notice a mink or coon track along the\\r\\ncreek, while he was gathering moss from the old logs. These tracks\\r\\nwould drive Frank nearly wild, and he would double his energy so as\\r\\nto get the shack finished so we could hit the trap line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we got the shack in good shape, we went to work getting up a\\r\\ngood supply of wood, sufficient to last through the season. We had an\\r\\nopen fireplace, so we cut the wood about three feet long. The wood\\r\\nwas now up near the camp door, ranked up in good snug piles. We then\\r\\ncut crotched stakes and drove them in the ground on each side of the\\r\\nranks, and laid poles in, then placed cross poles on and covered with\\r\\nhemlock boughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank was so anxious to get to work on the trap line, that he at\\r\\nfirst objected to putting in so much time in getting up the wood,\\r\\nsaying that we could get the wood at odd times. But when told that\\r\\nthere are no odd times on the trap line, he then worked the harder to\\r\\nget the supply of wood, including a good supply of dry pine for\\r\\nkindling fires, which we got by cutting a dry pine stub.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camp now being in good shape, we hit the trap line and began\\r\\nbuilding deadfalls for marten. We went onto the ridges into the thick\\r\\nheavy timber, where the marten were most likely to be found. We would\\r\\nselect a low hemlock to build the deadfalls under, so the trap would\\r\\nbe protected from heavy falls of snow, as much as possible. Some of\\r\\nthe traps we would drive crotched stakes and lay poles in them and\\r\\nthen cover with hemlock boughs to keep the snow off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had several lines of marten traps built, we went onto the\\r\\nstream and branches and built deadfalls for mink and coon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly every day we saw deer, but the weather was still too warm to\\r\\nkeep venison any length of time, so we did not carry our guns with\\r\\nus. When Frank would see a deer he would make grave threats that he\\r\\nwould carry his gun the next day. We were about two miles from the\\r\\nstage road. The stage made only one trip a week, so there was no way\\r\\nof disposing of a deer as long as the weather was so warm. It took\\r\\nbut little persuasion to convince Frank that it would be poor policy\\r\\nto kill deer as long as we could make use of but a small part of a\\r\\nsingle deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had gotten out a good line of deadfalls for marten, mink and\\r\\ncoon, and as it was now about the first of November and time to bait\\r\\nup the deadfalls, and set out what steel traps we had for fox, I told\\r\\nFrank that we would carry our guns with us and try to kill a deer for\\r\\nbait and camp use. Frank could hardly sleep that night; he was so\\r\\ndelighted to think that the time had come to quit the monkey\\r\\nbusiness, as he called it, and begin business.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe climbed the ridge where we knew there were some deer, following\\r\\ndown the ridge, one on each side, along the brow of the hill. We put\\r\\nin the entire day without getting a shot at a deer. That night it\\r\\nsnowed about an inch, so that in the wooded timber, one could see the\\r\\ntrail of the deer in the snow; but in hemlock timber there was not\\r\\nenough snow on the ground, so a track could be followed. We had\\r\\nkilled a squirrel or two, and had a little prepared bait, so we\\r\\nconcluded to bait a few traps until we struck a deer trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not succeed in finding the tracks of any deer until well along\\r\\nin the afternoon. It so happened that I got a shot at a deer that was\\r\\nnearly hidden from sight behind a large tree. I shot the deer\\r\\nthrough, just forward of the hips. We followed it only a short\\r\\ndistance when we found the bed of the deer, and there was blood in\\r\\nit, so it was plain to be seen in what manner the deer was wounded.\\r\\nAll still-hunters (excuse the word still-hunt; the word stalking does\\r\\nnot sound good to a backwoodsman) of deer know that when a deer is\\r\\nshot well back through the small intestines, that if conditions will\\r\\nallow, the right thing to do is to leave the trail for a time and the\\r\\ndeer will lie down. If left alone for an hour or two the hunter will\\r\\nhave but little trouble in getting his deer. So in this case, as we\\r\\nwere not far from camp and it was nearly sundown, I told Frank that\\r\\nwe had better let the deer go until morning, when we would have more\\r\\ndaylight ahead of us, and we would get the deer with less trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started for camp and had gone only a short distance when Frank\\r\\nsaid he would work along the ridge a little and see if he could not\\r\\nkill a partridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: FOOT OF TREE SET.]\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on to camp and when dark came I couldn\\'t see nor hear anything\\r\\nof Frank. I ate my supper, and as I could get no word from Frank\\r\\neither by shouting or firing my gun, I climbed to the top of the\\r\\nridge so I could be heard for a greater distance, but still I could\\r\\nget no answer. It had turned warmer and what little snow was on the\\r\\nground had melted. I could not follow his trail in the dark, so went\\r\\nback to camp and built a good big fire outside of the camp in case\\r\\nFrank should come in sight, he might see the light and come in. At\\r\\nintervals of half an hour, I would call as loud as I could. I kept\\r\\nthis up until midnight, when I lay down to get a little sleep,\\r\\nknowing that I could not help matters by staying up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daylight the next morning I was on the ridge at the place where I\\r\\nlast saw Frank, and by close watch managed to follow his trail while\\r\\nhe was in the hardwood timber, where there was a heavy fall of\\r\\nleaves; but when he struck into the heavy hemlock timber, I could no\\r\\nlonger track him. However, I had tracked him sufficiently far enough\\r\\nto see that he had gone back to look for the wounded deer. I made\\r\\ntracks in the direction I expected the wounded deer would be likely\\r\\nto lie down. After some searching I found the bed of the deer, also\\r\\ntracks of a man, which I knew to be Frank. But I could only follow\\r\\nthe trail a short distance from where he had driven the deer out of\\r\\nits bed. There were plenty of deer tracks all around, but knowing\\r\\nthat the wounded deer would naturally work down the draw, I worked my\\r\\nway along the hollow, keeping a close lookout for any signs of the\\r\\nwounded deer that I might chance to cross. At different times, I\\r\\nfound a few drops of blood, but no signs of Frank.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had worked down the hollow some ways, when I ran onto the wounded\\r\\ndeer; it staggered to its feet, but was too near gone to keep its\\r\\nfeet. I finished it by shooting it in its head. I removed the\\r\\nentrails as quickly as I could, bent down a sapling and hung the deer\\r\\nup, and then made tracks down the stream the best I could shouting\\r\\nand occasionally firing off my gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were in a big wilderness. No roads or inhabitants west of us for\\r\\nmany miles, and this was the course I feared Frank was most likely to\\r\\ntake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now began to think that I had a serious job on hands. I kept up the\\r\\nsearch all day without getting the least trace of Frank and returned\\r\\nto camp late that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting early the next morning, and taking a good lunch with me, I\\r\\ncrossed the head of Winfall Run and over the divide onto the waters\\r\\nof the Hamersley, continuing to shout and occasionally firing my gun.\\r\\nI had worked down the run some six or eight miles, when I heard some\\r\\none hollow two or three times in quick succession. I was quite\\r\\npositive it was Frank. It was miles from any inhabitants in a dense\\r\\nwilderness, and hunters were not common on those parts in those days.\\r\\nI immediately answered the call, and soon I could hear Frank coming\\r\\ndown the hill at breakneck speed, giving tongue at every jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe at once started for camp, Frank eating the lunch I had brought in\\r\\nmy knapsack, and telling of his trials, as we made tracks the best we\\r\\nwere able to for camp. Frank, in telling his story, would cry like a\\r\\nbaby, and then laugh like a boy with a pair of new boots. But he cut\\r\\nno more boy tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe finished the season\\'s hunt, catching a goodly bunch of fox,\\r\\nmarten, mink and coon, as well as killing a good bunch of deer. Had\\r\\nfur and venison brought as much in those days, as at the present\\r\\ntime, we would have bought an automobile, and put an end to this\\r\\nhoofing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White Deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not remember whether I have told the boys of the H-T-T the story\\r\\nof the white deer, which I had the good luck to get, and the picture\\r\\nof which was shown in one of the sporting magazines a few years ago.\\r\\nThe picture was sent to the magazine by Mrs. Prudence Boyington,\\r\\nRoulett, Pa., who was the owner of the deer at the time, and I\\r\\nbelieve a daughter of Mrs. Boyington still has the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the spring of 1878 or 1879 that a doe and a white fawn were\\r\\nseen on the hill just south of Lymansville. The fawn and its mother\\r\\nwere seen almost daily in some of the fields near the village, and\\r\\noften were seen in some one of the pastures with the cows. The fawn\\r\\nwould run and play about like a lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was plain to be seen from week to week that the fawn was rapidly\\r\\ngrowing, and as the open season for hunting of deer drew near it was\\r\\ngenerally understood that the white fawn and its mother should not be\\r\\nkilled. When the winter came on, the fawn and its mother were all at\\r\\nonce missing. The general supposition was that they had been killed,\\r\\nbut when spring came the doe and the white fawn (now a yearling deer)\\r\\nagain appeared on its old haunts of the year before. They had merely\\r\\ngone back into the more dense woods to winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong in June it was noticed that there were three deer instead of\\r\\ntwo. Another fawn had appeared on the scene, this time an ordinary\\r\\nspotted fawn. They were again daily seen during the summer the same\\r\\nas they were the year before. Now it had been strongly urged by the\\r\\npeople all about the country that these deer should not be killed,\\r\\nand there was none that was more strongly in favor of this than I\\r\\nwas. The deer were regularly seen again all summer and up to the last\\r\\ndays of October, when they again disappeared and all were anxious for\\r\\nspring to come to see if they would return as usual. When spring came\\r\\nthe deer came back as before, but in June \"the whole bunch came up\\r\\nmissing,\" and it was generally thought that they had changed their\\r\\nhaunts or they had been killed. The latter was strongly suspected.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had taken a scout through the woods on the hills back of the\\r\\nlocality where these deer had been frequenting and had seen signs\\r\\nthat convinced me that the white deer, at least, was still alive,\\r\\nalthough it had not been seen for a number of weeks. Here I wish to\\r\\nexplain that Coudersport is two miles from Lymansville and it is on\\r\\nthe hill between the two places that the white deer had been seen\\r\\nmost, and it was in the former place that the loudest cry for the\\r\\nprotection of this white deer came from.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about this time I had killed a deer in the big woods where\\r\\nseveral of us had been on a fishing trip and I took a piece of this\\r\\nvenison to a friend in town. It so happened that one of the side\\r\\njudges of our court (Stebens by name) was at the house of my friend.\\r\\nA few days later I was in a store belonging to a brother of the\\r\\nJudge, when the Judge came in and accused me of killing the white\\r\\ndeer. Of course I denied, and told the Judge that I would wager two\\r\\ndollars that the white deer was still living. The Judge said \"Very\\r\\nwell,\" and at the same time handed a two dollar bill to a man\\r\\nstanding by, by the name of Abison, who was listening to our\\r\\nconversation, which was quite heated. I told the Judge at the very\\r\\nfirst opportunity I would kill the white deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white deer was not seen in the woods any more, and I was charged\\r\\nwith killing it. I said nothing in regard to the charge, for I had\\r\\nnow made up my mind to kill it if I could. One day three or four\\r\\nweeks after I had made the wager, Mr. Abison came to me and handed me\\r\\ntwo dollars and said that the Judge had got his money and told him to\\r\\ngive me my money back as he (the Judge) did not want to take the\\r\\nmoney, that I had killed the white deer all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I was quite positive that the Judge had learned that the white\\r\\ndeer was still alive. I had heard that the white deer had again been\\r\\nseen in a field near town. Now this made me all the more determined\\r\\nto kill the white deer. I will explain that I had learned that\\r\\nseveral of the sportsmen of Coudersport, the Judge included, had had\\r\\ndogs after the white deer several times the previous fall, but it so\\r\\nhappened that there were no watchers at the place where the deer came\\r\\nto the creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat fall as soon as the first snow fell I went after the deer. I did\\r\\nnot strike the trail until quite late in the afternoon, and as the\\r\\ndeer left the woods where it had been accustomed to staying and went\\r\\ninto the big woods farther south, I left the trail for that day. I\\r\\nwould have got a shot at the deer if my attention had not been called\\r\\nin the wrong direction by the chirping of several blue jays which I\\r\\nthought were excited over the presence of the white deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was working the trail to the best of my ability and knew that I was\\r\\nclose to the game, when my attention was drawn by the chirping of\\r\\nthose blue jays which were down the side of a hill. I was working the\\r\\ntrail so as to be on vantage ground and could see from where I was\\r\\nstanding that the trail had turned slightly down the hill along the\\r\\nside of a fallen tree and in the direction of the chirping of the\\r\\njays. This led me to think that the jays were scolding the deer, so I\\r\\ncautiously advanced a few steps down the hill, expecting every moment\\r\\nto see the deer. While I was watching down the hill, I heard a slight\\r\\nnoise to my right and partly behind me. I looked in the direction in\\r\\nwhich the noise came from and was surprised to catch a glimpse of the\\r\\ndeer jumping the log near where I had last seen the trail. The log\\r\\nhid the deer from my sight so that I was unable to get a shot at it.\\r\\nThe deer had lain down close to the log, and had I taken a few more\\r\\nsteps in the direction I was going instead of giving attention to the\\r\\njays I would have seen the deer and made my word good the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too late in the day to follow the trail farther at this time,\\r\\nknowing that the deer would run a long distance before stopping. As I\\r\\nhad a team engaged to take me to my camp and I was anxious to get\\r\\nthere on the first tracking snow, I concluded to give the white deer\\r\\na rest a few days until I returned from camp in the big woods. I was\\r\\nin camp only a few days when the snow went off, so I came home. I had\\r\\nonly been home a day or two when a man by the name of Hill came to my\\r\\nhouse in great haste. He had been cutting logs en a hill, and looking\\r\\nacross onto a hill opposite where he was working, saw the white deer,\\r\\nso came to tell we what he had seen. I at once took my gun and\\r\\nstarted after the deer. I went up the hill in the direction that Mr.\\r\\nHill had seen the deer until I was quite sure that I was well above\\r\\nthe deer, then cautiously worked my way down the side of that hill.\\r\\nThere being no snow on the ground and the deer being white, I soon\\r\\ndiscovered it lying in its bed. I cautiously crept up within shooting\\r\\ndistance and fired, killing the deer instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will explain how it happened that these deer disappeared so\\r\\nsuddenly at the time Judge Stebens accused me of killing the white\\r\\ndeer and the wager was made between the Judge and your humble\\r\\nservant. A man by the name of Frank Williams had shot the deer\\r\\nbreaking a foreleg at the knee joint, and this caused the deer to\\r\\nremain hidden away until it recovered from the wound. The leg or\\r\\njoint was stiff when the deer was killed and the force of the bullet\\r\\nwas so spent that it lay against the skin after shattering the knee\\r\\njoint and I still have the ball which I took from the knee. I had the\\r\\ndeer mounted and Mrs. Boyington took it as she was collecting freaks\\r\\nand curios of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Day of Luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery hunter of long experience could tell of the ups and downs along\\r\\nthe trail consisting of good, bad and indifferent luck and as usual\\r\\ntell of our hits and let others tell of our misses, I will tell of a\\r\\nday of good luck. It was in November and there was no snow on the\\r\\nground. I was camping on the Holman branch of Pine Creek in\\r\\nPennsylvania and one night, just at dark, a party of several men came\\r\\nto my camp and asked to stay over night. They stated that they were\\r\\ngoing to camp on the opposite side of the ridge on the Sinnamahoning\\r\\nwaters. My camp was small but I made room for the hunters the best I\\r\\ncould.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis party was going into a section of country where I had several\\r\\nbear traps as well as a good number of smaller traps set for fox,\\r\\nmink, marten and other fur animals. As I wished to look these traps\\r\\nover the next day before this party got scattered about the woods\\r\\nwhere my traps were, I got up early the next morning, ate a hasty\\r\\nbreakfast and put a lunch into my knapsack and was ready to start out\\r\\nbefore the party of hunters was up. I cautioned the hunters to see\\r\\nthat the fire was safe when they left camp and then started on my\\r\\nday\\'s hunt without the slightest idea that I was starting on one of\\r\\nthe luckiest days I ever had.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to climb a high ridge, then my route was for some distance on a\\r\\nlong ridge, which I would follow for a distance of a mile and a half,\\r\\nwhen I dropped off the right hand side of the ridge into a ravine\\r\\nwhere I had a bear trap set. This ridge was a clean open one of beech\\r\\nand maple timber. I knew it would keep me busy the entire day to get\\r\\nover the trap line, the best that I could do, so had no intention of\\r\\nspending any time looking after deer. When I got to this open ridge,\\r\\nI took a dog trot along the ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was making good time when on looking ahead along the ridge I saw a\\r\\ngood-sized buck come from the left hand side of the ridge. He would\\r\\ntake a jump or two then drop his head to the ground and then take\\r\\nanother hop or two and again drop his head to the ground. I knew that\\r\\nhe was on the trail of other deer. I had hardly time to bring my gun\\r\\nto my shoulder when the buck wheeled and disappeared back over the\\r\\nridge from where he had come. I started on a run to where the deer\\r\\nhad gone out of sight, thinking that possibly I might catch him\\r\\nbefore he got out of range down the side of the hill. Imagine my\\r\\nsurprise when just as I reached the top of the hill, where I saw the\\r\\ndeer disappear from my sight, I almost ran against the buck. He had\\r\\nturned back to cross the ridge when I met him. He whirled down the\\r\\nhill but I was too close onto him and I caught him before he could\\r\\nget out of reach. I took out the deer\\'s entrails and bent down a\\r\\nsapling and hung the deer up, then I crossed the ridge and started\\r\\ndown the ravine to look after the bear traps.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was hurrying down the hill near a jam of fallen timber, when all at\\r\\nonce out jumped five or six deer from this timber. In an instant the\\r\\nwhole bunch was out of sight behind the jam with the exception of one\\r\\nlarge doe. I could see, one of her hips standing out from behind a\\r\\nlarge hemlock tree. Without hesitating a moment, I fired at what I\\r\\ncould see of the deer and it dropped out of sight as the gun cracked.\\r\\nI hurried through the jam of timber to where I saw the deer and there\\r\\nthe doe lay, trying to get on her feet. I soon ended her misery by\\r\\nshooting her in the head. I soon had her entrails out and hung up as\\r\\nI had the buck. It was the trail of this bunch of deer that the buck\\r\\nwas on when he ran into me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had hung up the deer I hustled on down the ravine to the bear\\r\\ntrap. When I got to the place where the trap was set it was gone. The\\r\\ntrail led down the ravine and was easy to follow as I hurried along\\r\\nand I soon found a small bear tangled up in a thicket of small brush.\\r\\nIt was only the work of a moment to fix bruin in shape to skin. After\\r\\nI had the hide off, I cut the bear up into quarters and hung the meat\\r\\nup in the trees. I toted the trap back up to where it was set and\\r\\nreset it then I went back down the hollow to where I had left the\\r\\nbear skin and took it on my shoulder and made tracks down the hollow\\r\\nto the main creek where I had a string of deadfalls set for mink and\\r\\ncoon. The bear skin was about all the load I cared to tote, but I had\\r\\nnot gone far down the creek before I had the skins of two good sized\\r\\ncoon and one mink tied to my load. The coon and mink skins I could\\r\\nget in my knapsack so they did not bother much.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter following the creek a distance of about one mile I left the\\r\\ncreek and went up a long narrow sawtooth point to cross the divide to\\r\\nthe Cross Fork waters where I had some bear, fox and marten traps\\r\\nset. When I was about two-thirds of the way up this point I stopped\\r\\nat the side of a large rock which would shelter me from the cold\\r\\nwind. The point was covered with low laurel. I had been watching down\\r\\nthe side of the hill to see if I could not catch sight of some animal\\r\\non the move, but I had not got a glimpse of even a squirrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had about finished my lunch, when I saw the motion of something\\r\\nmove in the laurel, forty or fifty yards below me. I picked up my gun\\r\\nand stood watching, when I again caught sight of the animal and in a\\r\\nmoment I saw the horns of a deer. I could get the outline of the\\r\\ndeer\\'s body so I said, \"Now or never,\" and let go the best I could at\\r\\nthe bunch, but when the smoke from the gun was gone, I could neither\\r\\nsee nor hear anything but stood ready with my gun to my shoulder. I\\r\\nagain saw a part of a deer move in an open space in the laurel. I\\r\\nagain fired at the bunch with the remark that I guessed that I could\\r\\ndrive him out of there after a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left the bear skin and knapsack at the rock, knowing that the rock\\r\\nwould be a good landmark to find them by and went down through the\\r\\nlaurel to see what effect my shot had. When I got to where the deer\\r\\nwere, when I shot, I readily saw plenty of blood on the green laurel\\r\\nleaves and I only had a few steps to go when I saw the buck lying\\r\\ndead. I cut his throat and stood waiting for the blood to stop\\r\\nflowing and saw a trail that was fresh. I could readily tell by the\\r\\nway the leaves and ground were torn up that the trail was of some\\r\\nanimal that was having a hard time to keep on its feet. You can\\r\\nimagine my joy and surprise to get two deer so unexpectedly. I had\\r\\nonly a few rods to go when I found a good big doe dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you may guess that I lost no time in getting the entrails out\\r\\nof these two deer and swinging them up as I had the other two for it\\r\\nwas getting well past noon. I would be a good five miles from camp\\r\\nwhen I got to my first marten trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I got to the top of the divide, I made the best time that was\\r\\nin me. I looked at several fox and marten traps but none had been\\r\\ndisturbed. When I got to the first bear trap on the divide I had an\\r\\noccasion to scold and scold hard, but all to no purpose. I found the\\r\\nlimb of a tree jammed in between the jaws of the trap. Of course, I\\r\\nthought some hunter had done me the favor and having as hard a stunt\\r\\nahead of me, you can guess that the trick was not pleasing to me.\\r\\nWell, here I learned how foolish it was to fly off the handle before\\r\\nyou know what has been doing. Now, after a little investigation, I\\r\\nfound that the limb had been broken from the tree by the wind and it\\r\\nso happened that it fell right onto the pan of the trap and sprang\\r\\nit. Setting the trap, I hurried on to the next bear trap and here I\\r\\nhad another chance to be disgusted, even more than in the first case.\\r\\nThis time it was a porcupine in the trap but there was nothing to be\\r\\ndone, only reset the trap and hurry on again. None of the other traps\\r\\nwere disturbed, neither the small traps nor the bear trap until I\\r\\ncame to the last marten trap which had a marten in it. It was now too\\r\\ndark to see to skin it so I was obliged to dump the carcass into the\\r\\nknapsack and tote it along with the coons and mink pelts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had about one mile to go to reach the road, then four miles to camp\\r\\nand I often thought what a hunter and a trapper would endure and call\\r\\nit sport. It must have been nearly nine o\\'clock when I got to camp,\\r\\nwhere I still found the hunting party. They had taken a part of their\\r\\noutfit to their camp grounds and had worked on their camp until\\r\\nnearly night when they returned to my camp to stay for the night and\\r\\nget the balance of their outfit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I was pleased to find them still in camp for they volunteered\\r\\nto go with me the next day and help me get the deer and bear out to\\r\\nthe road in return for venison and bear meat. This ended one of the\\r\\nluckiest and hardest day\\'s work that I ever did on the trail or trap\\r\\nline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Mixed Bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised some of my old trapper friends back East, that I would let\\r\\nthem, who were fortunate enough to be subscribers to the H-T-T, hear\\r\\nfrom me. I will say that this is a mountain region of the first\\r\\nmagnitude. A man that cannot mount a donkey and ride over a trail\\r\\nwhere the river is hundreds of feet below, or as it looks to be\\r\\nnearly under him, and the trail not more than twelve inches wide,\\r\\nhewn out of the solid rock, he had best remain in the East.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a sportsman\\'s paradise, and the trapper will find here prey\\r\\nin the way of bear, both black and brown, fisher, mink, raccoon, fox,\\r\\notter, panther, or as the natives call them, mountain lion, wildcat,\\r\\nskunk, civet cat and many other fur bearing animals and all quite\\r\\nnumerous. Deer seem to be very abundant. I counted thirteen in a lick\\r\\nthis morning, and it is not an uncommon thing to see from ten to\\r\\ntwenty in the licks at one time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fishing is said to be the best in the spring and fall. It is not\\r\\nan uncommon thing to catch salmon, weighing from six to thirty-five\\r\\npounds, and as it is only thirty-five miles to the Pacific Ocean,\\r\\nthey are of the very best quality. Mountain trout are plentiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother animal that is plenty is the mountain goat. Bear, mountain\\r\\nlion, and other signs are as numerous as those of rabbits in the\\r\\nEast. I am not prepared at this time, to say how shrewd these animals\\r\\nare to trap, but if they take bait as readily as they are reported\\r\\nto, they must not be very hard to catch. There is a bounty of $4.00\\r\\non wolves and the writer has seen numerous signs of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill say to my friends in the East that while on my way from the\\r\\ncoast to the ranch, a distance of only fifty miles, and the most of\\r\\nthe way over mountain trails, I stopped often to watch the deer\\r\\nfeeding along the side of the trail. When they saw you they would\\r\\ntrot off a short distance and begin feeding again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly last evening, Mrs. Evie Newell, shot and killed a large mountain\\r\\nlion that started into the yard after a pig. It seems to me panthers\\r\\nare thicker here than wildcats in Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nI have experimented with scents for years and have found scents of no\\r\\nparticular benefit for trapping the fox. I have tried the skunk and\\r\\nmuskrat scent, the matrix of the female fox taken at the proper time.\\r\\nI have had a female fox and have lead her to my trapping place, and I\\r\\nhave tried many so-called fox scents and all to no purpose. Fox urine\\r\\nmay, in some particular places, be used to some slight advantage. It\\r\\nis not so with other animals in regard to scents, for they do not use\\r\\nthe same acute instinct that the fox does.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not wish to insinuate upon those that do use scent, but for me,\\r\\nI would not give a cent for a barrel of so-called fox decoy. I boil\\r\\nmy traps in soft maple bark, hemlock boughs or something of that\\r\\nnature. I do not do this because the fox can be any more readily got\\r\\ninto the trap, but because it forms a glazing on the trap and thereby\\r\\nprevents them from rusting and the trap will then spring more\\r\\nreadily. It makes no difference how rusty the trap is, so far as\\r\\ncatching the fox is concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo boys, no scent for me, the fox soon learns to associate the scent\\r\\nbusiness with the man, then you are up against it. With me there is\\r\\nnothing mysterious about trapping. It is simply practical ways of\\r\\nsetting the trap, learned from many years of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had fifty years experience as a hunter and trapper. I have\\r\\nnetted wild pigeons in the Adirondack Mountains, in New York, to the\\r\\nIndian Territory, so you know that the articles in H-T-T are very\\r\\ninteresting to me. I would say that no young trapper should be\\r\\nwithout this journal, although I would advise them not to take too\\r\\nreadily to scents and decoys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the discussions that have been in H-T-T, one writer says he has\\r\\ntwenty ways to catch the fox; now I have just as many different ways\\r\\nas there are different conditions. I would say that no one can become\\r\\na successful trapper until he learns to comply with the natural\\r\\nconditions, which will differ with almost every trap he sets when\\r\\ntrapping fox, mink, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will tell my brother trappers what I have been doing this fall\\r\\n(1902) along the line of trapping. In August I took a trip through\\r\\nportions of Montana, Idaho and Washington, to look up a site to do a\\r\\nlittle trapping this winter. There is much more game here than in the\\r\\nEast, but nothing like you hear talked of. I found the mountains too\\r\\nsteep and the underbrush too thick and from what I could learn, I was\\r\\nafraid the weather was too cold for one of my age and condition of\\r\\nhealth, but, oh boys, what trout fishing I found in the Clearwater;\\r\\nthis is a branch of Snake River and empties into that river at\\r\\nLewiston, Idaho.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I found things, I thought I would return to old Potter County,\\r\\nPennsylvania, and have a little fun trapping the fox and skunk as\\r\\nthat is about the only game there is in this section when we have no\\r\\nbeechnuts, for that is the only mast we have here. We have no\\r\\nbeechnuts this season and most of the fur bearing animals have\\r\\nmigrated south of here where there are chestnuts, acorns and hickory\\r\\nnuts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers, I will tell you where my camp is, and you will always find\\r\\nthe latch-string out. My camp stands at the very head of the\\r\\nAllegheny River, 1700 feet above sea level. From the cabin door you\\r\\ncould throw a stone over the divide to where the water flows into the\\r\\nwest branch of the Susquehanna. In a half hour a person can, from my\\r\\ncamp, catch trout from the waters of the Allegheny, and the\\r\\nSusquehanna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have no beechnuts we have no bears, so I have not set my bear\\r\\ntraps. This will cut my sport considerably short. I have put out but\\r\\nabout sixty small traps, so I spend my time about equally between\\r\\ncamp and home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will send a picture of myself and my old dog Mage, who I believe\\r\\nknows more about trapping than some families. But poor old Mage is 13\\r\\nyears old and is following the down trail very rapidly. He is quite\\r\\ndeaf and gets around with difficulty. Poor fellow, he is nearly to\\r\\nthe end of the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND HIS OLD TRAPPING DOG--MAGE. THE BEST\\r\\nTRAPPING DOG THAT EVER TROD THE EARTH.]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe furs shown in the picture are my first four days\\' catch with\\r\\nforty traps: 9 fox, 2 coon, 1 mink and 7 skunk. My catch to date,\\r\\nNovember 25, in thirteen days is 14 fox, 27 skunk, 9 coon and 1 mink.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers, I will give some reasons why I do not write more of my\\r\\nexperience as a trapper. First, I am not much given to writing.\\r\\nSecond, my experiences in trapping are so different from so many\\r\\ntrappers who write, that I thought it best to say but little or\\r\\nnothing about trapping. I could call myself, \"Old Honesty,\" and\\r\\nthen write or cause it to be written and published in some of the\\r\\nsporting papers, that I had caught 300 fox this season, as I see one\\r\\ntrapper did, but I would not feel good about it after I had done so.\\r\\nFifty-seven fox are the most that I ever caught in one season.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brother was down to see me and I was pleased to meet him, I wish to\\r\\nsay, brother trappers, that if you should have an opportunity to meet\\r\\nBrother Stearns, you will find him a gentleman in every respect. But,\\r\\nBrother Stearns and I could not agree on the scent question, and he\\r\\ndid not like to believe that I handled my traps, bait and all\\r\\npertaining to the setting of the trap, bare-handed. He went so far as\\r\\nto hint that I was cold-blooded, and even felt of my pulse to see if\\r\\nmy circulation was all right. Hold on, I am mistaken, it was my hands\\r\\nthat he felt of to see if they were not cold, but he pronounced them\\r\\nall right. He then related a story about an old uncle of his and a\\r\\ncrow, but shook his head and said it did not do any harm to wear\\r\\ngloves if it did not do any good. That is all right, but we do not\\r\\nlike to be carrying unnecessary weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne word with Brother Chas. T. Wells. No, brother, I do not go much\\r\\non scents. Perhaps you would have caught more than 15 fox, but I do\\r\\nnot like to own that you could have done so. Now the first ten days\\r\\nthat I was in the woods, there were hundreds of head of cattle in the\\r\\nwoods, and the woods were full of men gathering them up, and one\\r\\ncould do but little or nothing in the way of trapping. Neither did\\r\\nthe 15 include the five that were stolen, nor the two that broke the\\r\\nchains and went off with the trap. By the way, Brother Stearns could\\r\\ntell you of a chase I had with one of those that carried off a trap,\\r\\nthe worst jaunt I have had in many a day. No brother, the only scent\\r\\nI use is the urine of the fox and I only use that in certain places.\\r\\nNo, I believe that one good method is much better than scents in\\r\\ntrapping the fox. If one wishes to use scents, they will find none\\r\\nbetter than some of those advertised in the H-T-T.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow brothers, while I do not believe that any one man is so cute he\\r\\ncannot find his equal, I do not like to believe but that I can catch\\r\\nas many fox as the next one--all things being equal. For the last ten\\r\\nyears I have not set traps over a scope of territory to exceed two or\\r\\nthree miles square and if Brother Stearns had been on the ground that\\r\\nI trapped on, a few days before I began trapping, he would have seen\\r\\nbut few fox signs. I usually trap on a different piece of ground each\\r\\nyear. I know of some trappers here that begin trapping the first of\\r\\nSeptember and they are good trappers too, but they are so greedy,\\r\\nthey are willing to kill the \"goose that lays the golden egg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years ago, through the courtesy of Mr. John Shawl, one of the\\r\\nTide Water Pipe Line Co\\'s telegraph operators, I was allowed the use\\r\\nof one of their offices for camping purposes during the trapping\\r\\nseason. Now, do not think that this office was located in a town, for\\r\\nit was not. On the contrary, it was located in the largest wooded\\r\\nsection of this locality, and on the old Jersey Shore Turnpike. There\\r\\nwas a path or sort of a woods road at the point where this office was\\r\\nlocated, leading from this road to another road, a distance of more\\r\\nthan four miles and making a cut off for people who wished to go on\\r\\nto the waters of the Sinnamahoning or Kettel Creek in Northern\\r\\nPennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was customary for me to stay in camp for a week or ten days and\\r\\nthen go home and stay two or three days. One day on returning from\\r\\none of my trips home, I had rather better luck than coming, getting 5\\r\\nfox, 3 coon and 1 wildcat. I usually hung my furs on the side of the\\r\\nbuilding close up under the eaves until I went home, then I would\\r\\ntake them home on the following morning of the day I had caught them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a rap at the door about five o\\'clock in the morning and on\\r\\ngoing to the door, I found two men with a lantern; one man of middle\\r\\nage, the other a young man. There had just been a fall of snow of\\r\\nabout four inches, and the men were going onto the Cross Fork of\\r\\nKettel Creek, deer hunting. They had stayed at a farm house on the\\r\\nother road and had started from this house between three and four\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning. Seeing a light in the office, they thought\\r\\nthey would come in and stay until daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman inquired what I was doing there. I informed him\\r\\nthat I was trying to trap a little. He said that he should not think\\r\\nit would pay me, but if I could catch a fox it would be different, as\\r\\nhe had seen several tracks along the road by the light of the\\r\\nlantern. He also told me that he had a recipe for making fox scent,\\r\\nthat was a dead sure thing, and as I lived so far from his place, I\\r\\nwould not be liable to interfere with his trapping, he would knock\\r\\noff one-half his usual price and sell me a recipe for five dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I would see what luck I had while they were gone, and it might\\r\\nbe possible that I would buy his recipe when he came back. He said,\\r\\ndelays were dangerous, and that I was losing the greatest opportunity\\r\\nof my life, that he might not come back that way. I thanked him, but\\r\\ntold him I would chance it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now daylight, and as the hunters stepped outside they noticed\\r\\nthe carcass of a wildcat, and I told them if they would step to the\\r\\ncorner of the building, they would see what I got yesterday. They did\\r\\nso, and gazed for one second at the pelts, then the older of the two\\r\\nsaid, \"Come, Charley, let\\'s be going,\" and they left without even\\r\\nbidding me good morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nComrades you do not know how I enjoy your letters as given in this\\r\\nsplendid magazine, especially so this winter (season of 1905-6) as I\\r\\nhave not been able to trap. But I have no kick coming for this is\\r\\nonly the third time in fifty years, but what I have been able to be\\r\\nout with the traps and gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that the readers of the H-T-T would be pleased to read\\r\\narticles from old veterans. The H-T-T has about reached the height of\\r\\nperfection so far as the trapper is concerned. There is none of the\\r\\nhigh top boot, fashionable, corduroy suits and checkered cap business\\r\\nabout the H-T-T. Success to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nBoys, you know how we all like to gather around a camp fire and talk\\r\\nover our hunting and trapping experiences, of how we caught a certain\\r\\nmink, fox, coon or bear, or how we killed a certain deer. So while we\\r\\nare out fishing I thought I would like to have a chat with the\\r\\ntrappers. And boys, all you who have not camped out for a week and\\r\\nhad a good time fishing, do not know how much you have lost,\\r\\nespecially those who need the care of a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, boys, take your camp outfit and go out into the woods among\\r\\nthe hills, streams and lakes. There you will find one of the\\r\\nmost competent doctors and nurses that ever treated the ills\\r\\nof human family. Do not forget to take a few copies of the\\r\\nHUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER along and other sporting magazines, as well as\\r\\nsome of the Harding Library, so while you are resting in camp you can\\r\\nvisit with the trapper boys all over the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is May 20, 1905, and the second time I have been out camping and\\r\\nfishing this spring. Trout are not as plentiful as they were forty\\r\\nyears ago by a great deal, but we still get all we can use, and that\\r\\nis plenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you are out fishing do not forget to keep a lookout for signs\\r\\nof game you will be trapping next winter. You may see where there has\\r\\nbeen a litter of young mink, fox or coon reared. While these animals\\r\\nare of migratory nature, they will, nevertheless, visit their old\\r\\nhomes frequently, so you will find these places a pretty sure place\\r\\nto make a catch next fall when you put our your traps. Do not forget\\r\\nthat during the summer is just the time to fix some of your best sets\\r\\nfor fox and other fur bearing animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have had many years experience in camping, let me say to those\\r\\nwho have never camped, and who expect to camp the coming season, that\\r\\nnow is the time to hunt up a partner and get acquainted. I have\\r\\ncamped many seasons in large woods both with and without partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEND OF FIFTY YEARS A HUNTER AND TRAPPER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper, by \\r\\nEldred Nathaniel Woodcock\\r\\n\\r\\n END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIFTY YEARS A HUNTER AND TRAPPER \\r\\n\\r\\n** This file should be named 34063.txt or 34063.zip **\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/4/0/6/34063/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Linda M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
