You separated yourselves to head around the island of Urukayxl and the Inkclaw Reef, making your way towards Rumblecusp, where you had planned in the near future, to hold Traveler Con.\n",
      "\n",
      "LAURA: Woo!\n",
      "\n",
      "MATT: Along the way, you drew the attention of a dangerous entity in the sea, what turned out to be a dragon turtle, a massive, massive threat. You managed to keep it at bay, fire towards it, only sustained a bit of damage to your hull before miraculously transforming it into a regular sea turtle, and then eventually a sea slug, leaving it in your wake, literally, and heading a bit off course, taking a little more time in your travel, but eventually making your way to the island of Rumblecusp, unscathed any further. Upon planting yourself on the outskirts of the island, and taking your ships to the shore, you began to-- you left the rest of the crew there, on the beach, to keep an eye, while you began to enter the jungle proper. There, within the tangled tree mass-- What? What did I miss?\n",

      "MATT: Heading into the jungles, a short time in, you found yourselves being hunted. And as these creatures, these black, panther-like beasts, you've seen before in the past, began to present themselves, ready to pounce, and attack. They themselves were assaulted by a small hunting party, of two individuals in appeared to be a semi-humanoid-bear state. Upon killing one of these creatures, and sending the other scattering, they began to prepare it for bringing back to their village, which you discovered exists in this island, a commune known as Vo, and they were eager to tell you about it, they were excited to meet newcomers to the island, and to show you the safest route back to the place that they call home. These individuals, named Pono and Jaina, carried the corpse of this displacer beast and alongside you, you are brought to this makeshift, driftwood, patchwork village. Some buildings looking much older than others, you can see large bridge networks that connected different structures, held aloft at different points in the few trees that still remain in this clearing, in the center of this dense jungle on Rumblecusp. People who lived here begin to come out excitedly and whisper about the new arrivals, until eventually you are brought to bear, and meet two of the three leaders of this village, one of which is a tall, lanky, male orc figure, with gray skin, bright smile, multiple tools hanging from his belt, that clangle as he walks, his hair pulled back into braids, to about the midpoint of his back, and a half-elf woman that you saw being brought down by a cluster of moving vines from atop a structure higher up in the tree. This half-elf female, tan of skin, sun-bleached, long, wild hair, with a leg made of vines, it looks like, steps down onto the ground, and approaches before saying, \"Welcome, so what brings you here?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "MATT: The woman named Viridian turns and looks to Lukash, and he gives a quirky grin in her direction. And she looks back towards you, \"I'm curious about the ramifications of bringing a god to an island that already is home to one, but we can certainly discuss the possibilities. But this is your reason for coming, you say?\"\n",

There is not much in the way of decisions we can make without a full quorum, but there is to be a meal tonight. We can prepare a place.

We've lost many through the generations to some of these hazards, predators, but so long as the scouting and hunting parties are keeping watch, and I am able to defend this village, we endure under the light of our god.\"\n",

By finding your destiny here, and being a part of the important presence of Vokodo, and keeping these people safe, and gathering from the island's many rewards and boons, it also takes from you the things that are less important in life. So many, if not most of us, don't quite recall where we were from. But in the long run, that's not as important, anyway.\"\n",

Those that did survive, were found as first, well--\" and Viridian points over to another side of the group over there, and you can see there's three individuals, look pretty scrappy and scarred up. Based on the missing teeth, and the rather intense demeanor, you can see they probably spent a harsh life at sea.

There is, for instance, the Winding Core, which is the most abundant home, where we mine from the very island itself the beautiful gems and diamonds, and various gifts from the land that we can refine, and thus bring to Vokodo as part of the worship and love that we offer. There are other places, such as the Shaded Tangle, which lies along the path towards the entrance to Vokodo's lair within the mountain itself. A cold place, where color seems to be muted, where the mists grow cold. There is the Ruin, far to the north, on the other side of the mountain.

Friends, Mighty Nein, you say? Right, this way, please, follow me.\" And Lukash leads you off, through the village. People still follow from a distance before slowly scattering off, going more about their business that they were already handling throughout the day. Eventually you come to a hollowed out tree trunk. The tree is cut off about 60 feet up, although looking at it, it may not have cut off, more than it just fell, maybe was old and diseased, or burned at the top, or whatever it is, at about 50 feet up, it kind of angles off, and the interior's completely hollowed out. As you step inside, underneath where the roots are, there's this nice little wooden door that pushes in, and it's a very humble, if somewhat cramped for the seven of you, abode. There's some basic furniture, some it looks like it was scavenged from a ship previously, based on the height and size of the stools. Some of it looks to be fashioned here. There are four beds, and some like cushions and basic blankets set up. The blankets are a little old, but they're functional.

But people begin to gather as the bonfires ignite, as the actual meals begin to cook, the creatures are set up to be charred and prepared and the large bonfire itself, just a beacon, the center of the social space here at the end of the day, is lit. The heat is immense, even from this distance, but people gather around. And you can watch as people grab stools and stumps, and whatever sort of sitting arrangement they have. They bring their own plates, which are a weird mix of old china that looks chipped or broken in places, to just wooden plates that have been carved from whatever they could find locally, to thick fronds they go ahead and place food on, but everyone eventually comes through and starts gathering meals, and finding a place to sit. Everything looking the direction of this bonfire, and there at the very south part of the bonfire, you can see there are seven stools set up in a semi-circle, and three large chairs facing the north side of it, their backs to the bonfire.

You can't even hear a single person breathe, as everyone's leaning forward. Yasha, as she begins to get into the sense of the song, storytelling though the harp itself, her eyes begin to close. And that's when the silent lightning begins to (cracking) arc behind her, causing these little flashes of blue back lighting across her shoulders, and her hair, and the sides of the harp.

With each pluck resonating and echoing, and growing louder, the movements become more fluid, and for a woman who is so known amongst you for the volumetric rage and forceful brutality, there is an unexpected grace to the movements. The gentle shifting of the wrist, the swaying with each progressive pull. And as the eyes are still closed, and the lightning is still flashing, you see Yasha in a vulnerable light you've not really seen before. In a healing light. And as the song comes to a close, and the what some people would call the spirit that takes over, whatever it is, that muse within you that brought this song through in this moment, this very briefly stressful moment, you can't believe you did that. As the lightning fades, (applause)\n",

Now, you guys push in for a short time, before you begin to realize the jungle itself beginning to grow darker, even more dense. The smells, the vegetation, and humid air shifting to an even colder, almost metallic scent. Unnatural. Like a wet iron-type smell to the air. No more than probably an hour into this journey or so, Viridian puts a hand up for a bit and points, and goes, \"Those vines there, the ones with the somewhat ruddy texture towards the bottom points,\" and you see across the multiple types of vine tangles around there, and large branches that are reaching, and jamming, intertwining with each other, you see some vines, of a thinner variety, that, as opposed to winding around, they dangle straight, almost like curtains. But they turn reddish, as they get closer and closer to the tip. She points them out, \"Avoid those, like, keep a distance. They are carnivorous.\" And as you glance up, you can see, there's a lot of the moss, the thick, dark moss, that grows up in these parts of the trees, on these vines, the moss, looks less moss, and you now get to see it, as it looks like strips of decaying flesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "LAURA: Whoa!\n",
      "\n",
      "MATT: And occasionally, in some of these knots and tangles, you can see a bone protruding, or remnants of some sort of decaying creature's remnants.\n",

      "\n",
      "MATT: Used the same word twice in the same phrase. Improvisation! But the mist itself seems to be taking on this iron-like taste. As you continue to push forward.\n",

      "MARISHA: Does it feel like the bloody remains are contributing to that irony taste? Or does that feel separate?\n",
      "\n",
      "MATT: There's similarities in that taste, but it's not blood. You know the taste of blood very well. You've taste a lot of your own in the past. But it's different. This is a sharper, and more-- more unnatural scent.\n",

      "\n",
      "MATT: As you begin to continue, you can see the moisture in the surrounding mists growing thicker. The tree trunks themselves are now growing slick with the liquid in the air. You can see drops of condensed moisture, falling from branches, and overhead areas. It is not a rainy day, but occasionally, there is enough moisture falling from the boughs above, that it feels like a gentle drizzle. You can see now, as the ground begins to roll with the terrain, there are little pools beginning to form. Dark, pools of liquid. At this point, Viridian once again places a hand up into the air to keep you all at bay and goes, \"Now, some of these pools contain just liquid, but there are some creatures that reside beneath them and exude a sticky substance, to attempt to trap you. Try your best to avoid touching the pools of liquid. Understood?\"\n",

And there's quite a bit of this, and you can watch, as you continue, these pools get larger, and eventually begin to completely envelop and fill the spaces between the trees, these troughs where the roots create the outer crown, or the rim, before the pool forms.
