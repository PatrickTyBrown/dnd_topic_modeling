Thank you so much for tuning in. Oh my gosh, everybody, today I am so excited for the incredible guest who's gonna be here talking with us about all things tabletop. You know her work. She is an animation TV writer for \"My Little Pony <|endoftext|>\n",
      " 0 <|player|> <|startoftext|>  Heroes of Pure Heart.\" She's also a dungeon master. You've seen her dungeon mastering on \"Girls Guts Glory,\" which is streamed from Wizards of the Coast. And you also can find her musical that she wrote and directed, \"STARRY,\" the musical, available on Spotify right now, as well as an upcoming project, which is gonna be incredible and D&D, an all-native D&D actual play show coming soon to a live stream near you. We are so excited to have her here on the show. Please give it up for Kelly Lynne D'Angelo. Equestria Girls,\" \"Final Space,\" and \"Mao Mao <|endoftext|>\n",

I am honored to be among this amazing list of folks you've had on your show, and also getting the chance to talk with you. It's just, it's really exciting, so thanks for having me. <|endoftext|>\n",
      " <|dm|> <|startoftext|>  Oh, I'm so, so glad, thank you so much. We're gonna start… Normally, we do a half hour of conversation, and then move into questions. Kelly, you actually got a question that is not even a question, I just wanted to start with it. The person says it's not a question. This is from one of ourDiscord users, TurboMan. And it was just so sweet that I had to start right away with it. \"Kelly Lynne, you and Joey Clift have been incredible voices for native representation entertainment, no question. Just wanted to express my appreciation for everything you do.\" So a little bit of- <|endoftext|>\n",

      " <|dm|> <|startoftext|>  Very, very lovely. We put up on our Discord that you were gonna be coming on the show to get some questions, and we just had that lovely compliment right out of the gate. Kelly, talk to me a little bit about you, your love for tabletop, where it started, what your journey beginning into tabletop RPGs started as and where it brought you. <|endoftext|>\n",
      " 0 <|player|> <|startoftext|>  Yeah, so it's been an interesting journey for me. I'm from Upstate New York, I'm from Rochester, and whole family's from Buffalo. So if you throw pretty much a dart at somewhere in Upstate New York, I have been from there, family's from there. I've lived there or I know it too well. That is just my experience. But growing up in Upstate, especially if you're from around there, and with the dynamism that my family had, as well, on both sides, there's not much to do. You've got your local, if you're lucky, within walking distance, I wasn't as lucky, but you have your movie theater, you have the outdoors, you have air and water and food on the table, (laughs) and I'm trying to think of what else you have. There's other stimuluses, but they're further away. You have to have a car, but generally speaking, it's a quaint life, and it's pretty simple. And I had always, as a young girl, stretched the borders and wanted more. I always felt I had it... I think I was just hyperactive. I mean, there's a lot of things we can dive into on that. But I've always had a lot of energy and I still do, kind of to this day. (laughs) So when I was really young, I was really, really active. I was dancing all the time. I was doing tons of extracurriculars, but it also put me into this weird space as young child where I was kind of a weird one. I was not just the black sheep in my school, but kind of the black sheep in the family. I was reading at advanced level, I was studying a lot. I wanted to learn a bunch of things, and I was just kind of weird. And it led to me kind of searching for this sense of belonging or this sense of community or comfort, especially exercising how overactive my mind was with storytelling. Did I play with Barbie dolls until I was 13? Did I play with Legos 'til I was 13? Did I give every single toy car that my family let me inherit, did I give them front stories and backstories and give them names and create a teen drama with every sin\n"

When your heart beats faster as he approaches, biology can explain why. Engineering can help him mast the inner workings of a complicated clock, so that he knows what time it is to make you dinner when you're coming home. But the one thing science cannot explain, is the mysteries of passion. When he aims his gun, doesn't a small part of you get jealous for the target, for stealing his attention for just a moment? When you call him \"darling,\" I've seen his hand tremble as if it knows no word more magical than that one. Your love for each other has crossed continents, pierced dimensions, traversed planes of existence. You have stood, in the face of gods, literal gods, and yet, Percy's face is the one burned in your head at night when you lay down to rest. Yes, science brought Percy and I together, but love is what brought you and he together. It will sustain both of you, as well as your many, many fancy children, for eternity. Do we understand love? No. There's no need. But large or small, cunning or naive, rich or poor, all of us at this wedding cherish it. And so a toast',\n",
